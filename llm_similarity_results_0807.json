Field\nAspects of the present disclosure relate generally to wireless communication systems, and more particularly, to an apparatus and method for power control biasing towards early decode success of voice calls.\n2. Background\nWireless communication networks are widely deployed to provide various communication services such as telephony, video, data, messaging, broadcasts, and so on to user equipment (UE). Such networks, which are usually multiple access networks, support communications for multiple users by sharing the available network resources. One example of such a network is the UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network (UTRAN). The UTRAN is the radio access network (RAN) defined as a part of the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS), a third generation (3G) mobile phone technology supported by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP). The UMTS, which is the successor to Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) technologies, currently supports various air interface standards, such as Wideband-Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA), Time Division-Code Division Multiple Access (TD-CDMA), and Time Division-Synchronous Code Division Multiple Access (TD-SCDMA). The UMTS also supports enhanced 3G data communications protocols, such as High Speed Packet Access (HSPA), which provides higher data transfer speeds and capacity to associated UMTS networks. High Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA) is a data service offered on the downlink of WCDMA networks.\nSome wireless communication networks, such as WCDMA, provide early voice frame termination functionality by which a UE receiver attempts early decoding of voice transport channels. If the early decode of the voice channel is successful, the UE receiver may be transitioned into a low-power state to preserve battery power and a base station may reduce its transmit power also. Accordingly, there is a need for a mechanism for power control biasing towards early decode success of voice calls.\nSUMMARY\nThe following presents a simplified summary of one or more aspects of systems, methods and computer program products for power control biasing towards early decode success of voice calls. This summary is not an extensive overview of all contemplated aspects of the invention, and is intended to neither identify key or critical elements of the invention nor delineate the scope of any or all aspects thereof Its sole purpose is to present some concepts of one or more aspects in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.\nIn one aspect, a method for power control biasing towards early decode success of voice calls includes measuring by UE a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of a downlink transmission. The method further includes requesting a base station to increase transmit power at the start of a transmission time interval (TTI) for a downlink voice call transmission. The method further includes demodulating one or more voice frames of the voice call transmission and performing early decoding of one or more demodulated voice frames. The method further includes determining whether the early decoding was successful. When the early decoding was successful, the method further includes terminating demodulation and decoding of the voice call transmissions and requesting the base station to decrease transmit power. When the early decoding was unsuccessful, the method further includes requesting the base station to decrease transmit power for the remainder of the voice call transmission.\nIn another aspect, an apparatus for power control biasing towards early decode success of voice calls includes a power control module configured to measure a SNR of a downlink transmission and request a base station to increase transmit power at the start of a TTI for a downlink voice call transmission. The apparatus further includes a demodulator configured to demodulate one or more voice frames of the voice call transmission. The apparatus further includes a decoder configured to perform early decoding of one or more demodulated voice frames and determine whether the early decoding was successful. When the early decoding was successful, the power control module further configured to terminate demodulation and decoding of the voice call transmissions and request the base station to decrease transmit power. When the early decoding was unsuccessful, the power control module further configured to request the base station to decrease its transmit power for the remainder of the voice call transmission.\nIn another aspect, an apparatus for power control biasing towards early decode success of voice calls includes means for measuring a SNR of a downlink transmission and means for requesting a base station to increase transmit power at the start of a TTI for a downlink voice call transmission. The apparatus further includes means for demodulating one or more voice frames of the voice call transmission and performing early decoding of one or more demodulated voice frames. The apparatus further includes means for determining whether the early decoding was successful. When the early decoding was successful, the apparatus further includes means for terminating demodulation and decoding of the voice call transmissions and requesting the base station to decrease its transmit power. When the early decoding was unsuccessful, the apparatus further includes means for requesting the base station to decrease its transmit power for the remainder of the voice call transmission.\nIn yet another aspect, a computer program product for power control biasing towards early decode success of voice calls comprises a computer-readable medium comprising code for measuring a SNR of a downlink transmission. The computer program product further includes code for requesting a base station to increase its transmit power at the start of a TTI for a downlink voice call transmission. The computer program product further includes code for demodulating one or more voice frames of the voice call transmission and performing early decoding of one or more demodulated voice frames. The computer program product further includes code for determining whether the early decoding was successful. When the early decoding was successful, the computer program product further includes code for terminating demodulation and decoding of the voice call transmissions and requesting the base station to decrease transmit power. When the early decoding was unsuccessful, the computer program product further includes code for requesting the base station to decrease its transmit power for the remainder of the voice call transmission.\nTo the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends, the one or more aspects comprise the features hereinafter fully described and particularly pointed out in the claims. The following description and the annexed drawings set forth in detail certain illustrative features of the one or more aspects. These features are indicative, however, of but a few of the various ways in which the principles of various aspects may be employed, and this description is intended to include all such aspects and their equivalents.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION\nThe detailed description set forth below in connection with the appended drawings is intended as a description of various configurations and is not intended to represent the only configurations in which the concepts described herein may be practiced. The detailed description includes specific details for the purpose of providing a thorough understanding of various concepts. However, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that these concepts may be practiced without these specific details. In some instances, well known structures and components are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid obscuring such concepts.\nFIG. 1 illustrates an example configuration of a radio frequency (RF) receiver of a user equipment (UE). The RF receiver 10 includes a RF antenna 11 that receives RF signals, such as voice, data, and control frames on a downlink channel from a base station (e.g., Node B) and transforms them into electromagnetic signals for processing. The electromagnetic signals are transmitted to amplifier circuit 12, which may include a low noise amplifier (LNA), analog-to-digital converter (ADC), variable gain amplifier (VGA) and automatic gain control (AGC) circuit, which calibrates operating range of the LNA, ADC and VGA. The amplified and digitized signals are then passed to a Rake receiver 13, which is configured to mitigate the effects of the multipath fading. Rake receiver 13 may include a path search for identifying different propagation paths of the received signal, a channel estimator that estimate channel conditions, such as time delay, amplitude and phase for each path component, and a path combiner that combines strongest multipath components of the received signal into one signal. The resulting signal is then demodulated by the demodulator 16, such as a QPSK or QAM demodulator. The demodulated signal is passed to decoder 17, such as Viterbi decoder, which performs decoding of the convolutionally encoded data. The RF receiver 10 also includes a processor 14, such as a microprocessor or microcontroller, which executes programs for controlling operation of the components of the receiver 10, and memory 15 that stores runtime data and programs executable by the processor 14.\nIn WCDMA systems, voice calls may be encoded and transmitted in separate voice transport channels. For example, a WCDMA base station may use an Adaptive Multi Rate (AMR) coding scheme for processing voice calls by which voice data is encoded into three classes of data bits, e.g., classes A, B, and C, having different levels of importance. The AMR coded data is processed as three subflows (e.g., one subflow for each class of data) for a Dedicated Traffic Channel (DTCH) at the Radio Link Control (RLC) layer and sent on three separate voice transport channels (channels 1, 2 and 3, respectively for each class of data) at the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer. Each transport channel is associated with a transmission time interval (TTI) that may span one, two, four, or eight 10-millisecond (ms) slots.\nThe WCDMA power control mechanism generally allows the UE to send in every TTI slot an Uplink (UL) transmit power control (TPC) command to the base station requesting to increase or decrease power at which voice signals are transmitted on the downlink (DL) transport channels. To determine whether to request more or less power from the base station, the UE can measure a Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) or Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) from the common or dedicated pilots transmitted on the dedicated physical channel (DPCH) and compare the measured SINR (or SNR) to the desired SINR_TARGET needed to meet the block error rate (BLER) requirements set forth by the network. If SINR<SINR_TARGET, the UE can send an ULTPC UP command (1 bit) to the base station to request more power on the DL channel; and if SINR>SINR_TARGET, then the UE can send an ULTPC DOWN command (0 bit) to request less power on the DL channel. This algorithm is illustrated in the FIG. 2. In various aspects, the SINR_TARGET may be updated in the course of the TTI or at the end of the TTI in response to any cyclic redundancy check (CRC) status updates. The SINR_TARGET may be updated in a manner that the BLER targets set forth by the network are achieved. In another aspect an SNR and SNR_TARGET can be used for calculation of the appropriate TPC commands.\nAs explained above, some WCDMA systems provide early voice frame termination functionality by which early decoding of data on voice transport channels is attempted by the UE receiver 10, so that the receiver 10 may be transitioned into a low-power state to preserver UE batter power if the early decode of the received voice frames is deemed successful. Therefore, it is desirable to increase the rate of early decode success through biasing of power control towards the beginning of TTI. To that end, in one implementation, the UE receiver 10 includes a power control module 18 configured to request more power for the power control loop at the beginning of the TTI, e.g., first 10 ms of TTI, of the voice transport channels to improve early decode success, request less power later in the TTI to minimize network impact on average, and/or request less power later in the TTI in case of early decode success.\nIn one example implementation, the power control module 18 of the UE receiver 10 may be configured to implement a power control biasing algorithm illustrated in FIG. 3 to request the power control loop to bias more power at the start of a TTI and less power thereafter. As shown, the module 18 is configured to measure SINR (or SNR) at the beginning of the TTI, and in the first K1 slots of the TTI, generate a ULTPC DOWN command if SINR>SINR_TARGET+K2 and ULTPC UP command otherwise. Then, the UE receiver 10 may attempt early decode after K1 slots. In the rest of the TTI, if early decode was not successful, generate a ULTPC DOWN command if SINR>SINR_TARGET+K3 and ULTPC UP command otherwise. If early decode was successful, generate a ULTPC DOWN command if SINR>SINR_TARGET+K4 and ULTPC UP command otherwise. In an example aspect, value of K1=15 slots, and values of power offsets K2=1 dB, K3=−1 dB, and K4=−2 dB. These parameters may be optimized offline in a simulation environment or adaptively updated in the course of the voice call. In one aspect, power control module 18 may dynamically tune the biasing algorithm and biasing parameters over time in an adaptive manner to further optimize power control and improve early decode success rate.\nFIG. 4 is an example methodology of power control biasing towards early decode success of voice calls. In one aspect, the method 40 may be implemented in a UE receiver, such as receiver 10 of FIG. 1. At step 41, the method 40 includes measuring SINR of downlink channel transmissions. For example, in one example, the power control module 18 of the receiver 10 of FIG. 1 may be configured to measure SINR (or SNR) on the DL channel. At step 42, the method 40 includes requesting the base station to increase transmit power at start of TTI for a downlink voice call transmission. In one aspect, the power control module 18 of the receiver 10 may be configured to send an ULTPC UP command requesting the base station to increase its transmit power. At step 43, the method 40 includes demodulating one or more voice frames on one or more voice transport channels. In one aspect, the demodulator 16 of the UE receiver 10 may be configured to demodulate the received voice frames. At step 44, the method 40 includes performing early decode of one or more demodulated voice frames or parts of the frame. In one aspect, the decoder 17 of the UE receiver 10 may be configured to perform early decode of one or more voice frames or parts of a frame. At step 45, the method 40 includes determining if early decode was successful. In one aspect, the decoder 17 may be configured to determine if the early decode of the voice frame(s) or parts of the frame is successful, by for example performing a CRC or other known techniques. If the early decode was successful, at step 46, the method 40 includes terminating demodulation and decoding of the voice call transmissions and requesting the base station to decrease its transmit power. If the early decoding was unsuccessful, then at step 47, the method 40 includes requesting the base station to decrease its transmit power for the remainder of voice call transmission, and continuing at step 48, demodulation and decoding of the voice call transmissions at the reduced power. In one aspect, the power control module 18 may be configured to send an ULTPC DOWN command requesting the base station to decrease its transmit power based on determination by the decoder 17 whether the early decode of the voice frames was successful or unsuccessful.\nFIG. 5 illustrates an example electrical system 50 for power control biasing towards early decode success of voice calls according to aspects disclosed herein. The system 50 may be implemented in a RF receiver, such as UE receiver 10 of FIG. 1. It is to be appreciated that system 50 is represented as including functional blocks, which may correspond to the components of the UE receiver 10, implemented by a processor, software, or combination thereof (e.g., firmware). System 50 includes a logical grouping 51 of electrical components that can act in conjunction. For instance, logical grouping 51 can include an electrical component 52 for measuring a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of a downlink transmission. Moreover, logical grouping 51 can include an electrical component 53 for requesting to increase transmit power at the start of a TTI for a DL voice call transmission. Moreover, logical grouping 51 can include an electrical component 54 for demodulating one or more voice frames of the voice call transmission. Moreover, logical grouping 51 can include an electrical component 55 for performing early decoding of one or more demodulated voice frames. Moreover, logical grouping 51 can include an electrical component 56 for determining whether the early decoding was successful. Moreover, logical grouping 51 can include an electrical component 57 for, when the early decoding was successful, terminating demodulation and decoding of the voice call transmissions and requesting the base station to decrease transmit power. Moreover, logical grouping 51 can include an electrical component 58 for, when the early decoding was unsuccessful, requesting the base station to decrease transmit power for the remainder of the voice call transmission. Additionally, system 50 can include a memory 59 that retains instructions for executing functions associated with the electrical components 52-58, stores data used or obtained by the electrical components 52-58, etc. While shown as being external to memory 59, it is to be understood that one or more of the electrical components 52-58 can exist within memory 59. In one example, electrical components 52-58 can comprise at least one processor, or each electrical component 52-58 can be a corresponding module of at least one processor. Moreover, in an additional or alternative example, electrical components 52-58 can be a computer program product including a computer readable medium, where each of the electrical components 52-58 can be corresponding code.\nFIG. 6 is a block diagram illustrating an example of a hardware implementation for an apparatus 100, such as a UE, employing a processing system 114, such as a RF receiver 10 of FIG. 1. In this example, the processing system 114 may be implemented with a bus architecture, represented generally by the bus 102. The bus 102 may include any number of interconnecting buses and bridges depending on the specific application of the processing system 114 and the overall design constraints. The bus 102 links together various circuits including one or more processors, represented generally by the processor 104, and computer-readable media, represented generally by the computer-readable medium 106. The bus 102 may also link various other circuits such as timing sources, peripherals, voltage regulators, and power management circuits, which are well known in the art, and therefore, will not be described any further. A bus interface 108 provides an interface between the bus 102 and a transceiver 110. The transceiver 110 provides a means for communicating with various other apparatus over a transmission medium. Depending upon the nature of the apparatus, a user interface 112 (e.g., keypad, display, speaker, microphone, joystick) may also be provided.\nThe processor 104 is responsible for managing the bus 102 and general processing, including the execution of software stored on the computer-readable medium 106. The software, when executed by the processor 104, causes the processing system 114 to perform the various functions described infra for any particular apparatus. In one aspect, the processor 104 includes a power control module 18 that performs power control biasing towards early decode success of voice calls according to aspects disclosed herein. The computer-readable medium 106 may also be used for storing data that is manipulated by the processor 104 when executing software.\nThe systems and methods for performing power control biasing towards early decode success of voice calls according to various aspects presented throughout this disclosure may be implemented across a broad variety of telecommunication systems, network architectures, and communication standards. By way of example and without limitation, the aspects of the present disclosure illustrated in FIG. 7 are presented with reference to a UMTS system 200 employing a W-CDMA air interface. A UMTS network includes three interacting domains: a Core Network (CN) 204, a UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network (UTRAN) 202, and User Equipment (UE) 210. In one aspect, the UE 210 includes a RF receiver 10 of FIG. 1. In this example, the UTRAN 202 provides various wireless services including telephony, video, data, messaging, broadcasts, and/or other services. The UTRAN 202 may include a plurality of Radio Network Subsystems (RNSs) such as an RNS 207, each controlled by a respective Radio Network Controller (RNC) such as an RNC 206. Here, the UTRAN 202 may include any number of RNCs 206 and RNSs 207 in addition to the RNCs 206 and RNSs 207 illustrated herein. The RNC 206 is an apparatus responsible for, among other things, assigning, reconfiguring and releasing radio resources within the RNS 207. The RNC 206 may be interconnected to other RNCs (not shown) in the UTRAN 202 through various types of interfaces such as a direct physical connection, a virtual network, or the like, using any suitable transport network.\nCommunication between a UE 210 and a Node B 208 may be considered as including a physical (PHY) layer and a medium access control (MAC) layer. Further, communication between a UE 210 and an RNC 206 by way of a respective Node B 208 may be considered as including a radio resource control (RRC) layer. In the instant specification, the PHY layer may be considered layer 1; the MAC layer may be considered layer 2; and the RRC layer may be considered layer 3. Information hereinbelow utilizes terminology introduced in the RRC Protocol Specification, 3GPP TS 25.331 v9.1.0, incorporated herein by reference.\nThe geographic region covered by the RNS 207 may be divided into a number of cells, with a radio transceiver apparatus serving each cell. A radio transceiver apparatus is commonly referred to as a Node B in UMTS applications, but may also be referred to by those skilled in the art as a base station (BS), a base transceiver station (BTS), a radio base station, a radio transceiver, a transceiver function, a basic service set (BSS), an extended service set (ESS), an access point (AP), or some other suitable terminology. For clarity, three Node Bs 208 are shown in each RNS 207; however, the RNSs 207 may include any number of wireless Node Bs. The Node Bs 208 provide wireless access points to a CN 204 for any number of UEs 210. Examples of a UE 210 include a cellular phone, a smart phone, a session initiation protocol (SIP) phone, a laptop, a notebook, a netbook, a smartbook, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a satellite radio, a global positioning system (GPS) device, a multimedia device, a video device, a digital audio player (e.g., MP3 player), a camera, a game console, or any other similar functioning device. The UE 210 may also be referred to by those skilled in the art as a mobile station, a subscriber station, a mobile unit, a subscriber unit, a wireless unit, a remote unit, a mobile device, a wireless device, a wireless communications device, a remote device, a mobile subscriber station, an access terminal, a mobile terminal, a wireless terminal, a remote terminal, a handset, a terminal, a user agent, a mobile client, a client, or some other suitable terminology. In a UMTS system, the UE 210 may further include a universal subscriber identity module (USIM) 211, which contains a user's subscription information to a network. For illustrative purposes, one UE 210 is shown in communication with a number of the Node Bs 208. The DL, also called the forward link, refers to the communication link from a Node B 208 to a UE 210, and the UL, also called the reverse link, refers to the communication link from a UE 210 to a Node B 208.\nThe CN 204 interfaces with one or more access networks, such as the UTRAN 202. As shown, the CN 204 is a GSM core network. However, as those skilled in the art will recognize, the various concepts presented throughout this disclosure may be implemented in a RAN, or other suitable access network, to provide UEs with access to types of CNs other than GSM networks.\nThe CN 204 includes a circuit-switched (CS) domain and a packet-switched (PS) domain. Some of the circuit-switched elements are a Mobile services Switching Centre (MSC), a Visitor location register (VLR) and a Gateway MSC. Packet-switched elements include a Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) and a Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN). Some network elements, like EIR, HLR, VLR and AuC may be shared by both of the circuit-switched and packet-switched domains. In the illustrated example, the CN 204 supports circuit-switched services with a MSC 212 and a GMSC 214. In some applications, the GMSC 214 may be referred to as a media gateway (MGW). One or more RNCs, such as the RNC 206, may be connected to the MSC 212. The MSC 212 is an apparatus that controls call setup, call routing, and UE mobility functions. The MSC 212 also includes a VLR that contains subscriber-related information for the duration that a UE is in the coverage area of the MSC 212. The GMSC 214 provides a gateway through the MSC 212 for the UE to access a circuit-switched network 216. The GMSC 214 includes a home location register (HLR) 215 containing subscriber data, such as the data reflecting the details of the services to which a particular user has subscribed. The HLR is also associated with an authentication center (AuC) that contains subscriber-specific authentication data. When a call is received for a particular UE, the GMSC 214 queries the HLR 215 to determine the UE's location and forwards the call to the particular MSC serving that location.\nThe CN 204 also supports packet-data services with a serving GPRS support node (SGSN) 218 and a gateway GPRS support node (GGSN) 220. GPRS, which stands for General Packet Radio Service, is designed to provide packet-data services at speeds higher than those available with standard circuit-switched data services. The GGSN 220 provides a connection for the UTRAN 202 to a packet-based network 222. The packet-based network 222 may be the Internet, a private data network, or some other suitable packet-based network. The primary function of the GGSN 220 is to provide the UEs 210 with packet-based network connectivity. Data packets may be transferred between the GGSN 220 and the UEs 210 through the SGSN 218, which performs primarily the same functions in the packet-based domain as the MSC 212 performs in the circuit-switched domain.\nAn air interface for UMTS may utilize a spread spectrum Direct-Sequence Code Division Multiple Access (DS-CDMA) system. The spread spectrum DS-CDMA spreads user data through multiplication by a sequence of pseudorandom bits called chips. The “wideband” W-CDMA air interface for UMTS is based on such direct sequence spread spectrum technology and additionally calls for a frequency division duplexing (FDD). FDD uses a different carrier frequency for the UL and DL between a Node B 208 and a UE 210. Another air interface for UMTS that utilizes DS-CDMA, and uses time division duplexing (TDD), is the TD-SCDMA air interface. Those skilled in the art will recognize that although various examples described herein may refer to a W-CDMA air interface, the underlying principles may be equally applicable to a TD-SCDMA air interface.\nAn HSPA air interface includes a series of enhancements to the 3G/W-CDMA air interface, facilitating greater throughput and reduced latency. Among other modifications over prior releases, HSPA utilizes hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ), shared channel transmission, and adaptive modulation and coding. The standards that define HSPA include HSDPA (high speed downlink packet access) and HSUPA (high speed uplink packet access, also referred to as enhanced uplink, or EUL). HSDPA utilizes as its transport channel the high-speed downlink shared channel (HS-DSCH). The HS-DSCH is implemented by three physical channels: the high-speed physical downlink shared channel (HS-PDSCH), the high-speed shared control channel (HS-SCCH), and the high-speed dedicated physical control channel (HS-DPCCH).\nAmong these physical channels, the HS-DPCCH carries the HARQ ACK/NACK signaling on the uplink to indicate whether a corresponding packet transmission was decoded successfully. That is, with respect to the downlink, the UE 210 provides feedback to the node B 208 over the HS-DPCCH to indicate whether it correctly decoded a packet on the downlink.\nHS-DPCCH further includes feedback signaling from the UE 210 to assist the node B 208 in taking the right decision in terms of modulation and coding scheme and precoding weight selection, this feedback signaling including the CQI and PCI.\n“HSPA Evolved” or HSPA+ is an evolution of the HSPA standard that includes MIMO and 64-QAM, enabling increased throughput and higher performance. That is, in an aspect of the disclosure, the node B 208 and/or the UE 210 may have multiple antennas supporting MIMO technology. The use of MIMO technology enables the node B 208 to exploit the spatial domain to support spatial multiplexing, beamforming, and transmit diversity.\nMultiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) is a term generally used to refer to multi-antenna technology, that is, multiple transmit antennas (multiple inputs to the channel) and multiple receive antennas (multiple outputs from the channel). MIMO systems generally enhance data transmission performance, enabling diversity gains to reduce multipath fading and increase transmission quality, and spatial multiplexing gains to increase data throughput.\nSpatial multiplexing may be used to transmit different streams of data simultaneously on the same frequency. The data steams may be transmitted to a single UE 210 to increase the data rate or to multiple UEs 210 to increase the overall system capacity. This is achieved by spatially precoding each data stream and then transmitting each spatially precoded stream through a different transmit antenna on the downlink. The spatially precoded data streams arrive at the UE(s) 210 with different spatial signatures, which enables each of the UE(s) 210 to recover the one or more the data streams destined for that UE 210. On the uplink, each UE 210 may transmit one or more spatially precoded data streams, which enables the node B 208 to identify the source of each spatially precoded data stream.\nSpatial multiplexing may be used when channel conditions are good. When channel conditions are less favorable, beamforming may be used to focus the transmission energy in one or more directions, or to improve transmission based on characteristics of the channel. This may be achieved by spatially precoding a data stream for transmission through multiple antennas. To achieve good coverage at the edges of the cell, a single stream beamforming transmission may be used in combination with transmit diversity.\nGenerally, for MIMO systems utilizing n transmit antennas, n transport blocks may be transmitted simultaneously over the same carrier utilizing the same channelization code. Note that the different transport blocks sent over the n transmit antennas may have the same or different modulation and coding schemes from one another.\nOn the other hand, Single Input Multiple Output (SIMO) generally refers to a system utilizing a single transmit antenna (a single input to the channel) and multiple receive antennas (multiple outputs from the channel). Thus, in a SIMO system, a single transport block is sent over the respective carrier.\nFIG. 8 illustrates an access network 300 in a UTRAN architecture in which various aspects of systems and methods for power control biasing towards early decode success of voice calls can be implemented. In particular, network 300 may include one or more UEs having RF receiver 10 of FIG. 1. The multiple access wireless communication system includes multiple cellular regions (cells), including cells 302, 304, and 306, each of which may include one or more sectors. The multiple sectors can be formed by groups of antennas with each antenna responsible for communication with UEs in a portion of the cell. For example, in cell 302, antenna groups 312, 314, and 316 may each correspond to a different sector. In cell 304, antenna groups 318, 320, and 322 each correspond to a different sector. In cell 306, antenna groups 324, 326, and 328 each correspond to a different sector. The cells 302, 304 and 306 may include several wireless communication devices, e.g., User Equipment or UEs, which may be in communication with one or more sectors of each cell 302, 304 or 306. For example, UEs 330 and 332 may be in communication with Node B 342, UEs 334 and 336 may be in communication with Node B 344, and UEs 338 and 340 can be in communication with Node B 346. Here, each Node B 342, 344, 346 is configured to provide an access point to a CN 204 (see FIG. 7) for all the UEs 330, 332, 334, 336, 338, 340 in the respective cells 302, 304, and 306. In one aspect, the UEs 330, 332, 334, 336, 338, 340 may include RF receiver 10 of FIG. 1.\nAs the UE 334 moves from the illustrated location in cell 304 into cell 306, a serving cell change (SCC) or handover may occur in which communication with the UE 334 transitions from the cell 304, which may be referred to as the source cell, to cell 306, which may be referred to as the target cell. Management of the handover procedure may take place at the UE 334, at the Node Bs corresponding to the respective cells, at a radio network controller 206 (see FIG. 7), or at another suitable node in the wireless network. For example, during a call with the source cell 304, or at any other time, the UE 334 may monitor various parameters of the source cell 304 as well as various parameters of neighboring cells such as cells 306 and 302. Further, depending on the quality of these parameters, the UE 334 may maintain communication with one or more of the neighboring cells. During this time, the UE 334 may maintain an Active Set, that is, a list of cells that the UE 334 is simultaneously connected to (i.e., the UTRA cells that are currently assigning a downlink dedicated physical channel DPCH or fractional downlink dedicated physical channel F-DPCH to the UE 334 may constitute the Active Set).\nThe modulation and multiple access scheme employed by the access network 300 may vary depending on the particular telecommunications standard being deployed. By way of example, the standard may include Evolution-Data Optimized (EV-DO) or Ultra Mobile Broadband (UMB). EV-DO and UMB are air interface standards promulgated by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project 2 (3GPP2) as part of the CDMA2000 family of standards and employs CDMA to provide broadband Internet access to mobile stations. The standard may alternately be Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (UTRA) employing Wideband-CDMA (W-CDMA) and other variants of CDMA, such as TD-SCDMA; Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) employing TDMA; and Evolved UTRA (E-UTRA), Ultra Mobile Broadband (UMB), IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi), IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX), IEEE 802.20, and Flash-OFDM employing OFDMA. UTRA, E-UTRA, UMTS, LTE, LTE Advanced, and GSM are described in documents from the 3GPP organization. CDMA2000 and UMB are described in documents from the 3GPP2 organization. The actual wireless communication standard and the multiple access technology employed will depend on the specific application and the overall design constraints imposed on the system.\nFIG. 9 is a block diagram of a Node B 510 in communication with a UE 550, where the Node B 510 may be the Node B 208 in FIG. 7, and the UE 550 may be the UE 210 in FIG. 7. In one aspect, the UE 550 includes a RF receiver 10 of FIG. 1. In the downlink communication, a transmit processor 520 may receive data from a data source 512 and control signals from a controller/processor 540. The transmit processor 520 provides various signal processing functions for the data and control signals, as well as reference signals (e.g., pilot signals). For example, the transmit processor 520 may provide cyclic redundancy check (CRC) codes for error detection, coding and interleaving to facilitate forward error correction (FEC), mapping to signal constellations based on various modulation schemes (e.g., binary phase-shift keying (BPSK), quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK), M-phase-shift keying (M-PSK), M-quadrature amplitude modulation (M-QAM), and the like), spreading with orthogonal variable spreading factors (OVSF), and multiplying with scrambling codes to produce a series of symbols. Channel estimates from a channel processor 544 may be used by a controller/processor 540 to determine the coding, modulation, spreading, and/or scrambling schemes for the transmit processor 520. These channel estimates may be derived from a reference signal transmitted by the UE 550 or from feedback from the UE 550. The symbols generated by the transmit processor 520 are provided to a transmit frame processor 530 to create a frame structure. The transmit frame processor 530 creates this frame structure by multiplexing the symbols with information from the controller/processor 540, resulting in a series of frames. The frames are then provided to a transmitter 532, which provides various signal conditioning functions including amplifying, filtering, and modulating the frames onto a carrier for downlink transmission over the wireless medium through antenna 534. The antenna 534 may include one or more antennas, for example, including beam steering bidirectional adaptive antenna arrays or other similar beam technologies.\nAt the UE 550, a receiver 554 receives the downlink transmission through an antenna 552 and processes the transmission to recover the information modulated onto the carrier. The information recovered by the receiver 554 is provided to a receive frame processor 560, which parses each frame, and provides information from the frames to a channel processor 594 and the data, control, and reference signals to a receive processor 570. The receive processor 570 then performs the inverse of the processing performed by the transmit processor 520 in the Node B 510. More specifically, the receive processor 570 descrambles and despreads the symbols, and then determines the most likely signal constellation points transmitted by the Node B 510 based on the modulation scheme. These soft decisions may be based on channel estimates computed by the channel processor 594. The soft decisions are then decoded and deinterleaved to recover the data, control, and reference signals. The CRC codes are then checked to determine whether the frames were successfully decoded. The data carried by the successfully decoded frames will then be provided to a data sink 572, which represents applications running in the UE 550 and/or various user interfaces (e.g., display). Control signals carried by successfully decoded frames will be provided to a controller/processor 590. When frames are unsuccessfully decoded by the receiver processor 570, the controller/processor 590 may also use an acknowledgement (ACK) and/or negative acknowledgement (NACK) protocol to support retransmission requests for those frames.\nIn the uplink, data from a data source 578 and control signals from the controller/processor 590 are provided to a transmit processor 580. The data source 578 may represent applications running in the UE 550 and various user interfaces (e.g., keyboard). Similar to the functionality described in connection with the downlink transmission by the Node B 510, the transmit processor 580 provides various signal processing functions including CRC codes, coding and interleaving to facilitate FEC, mapping to signal constellations, spreading with OVSFs, and scrambling to produce a series of symbols. Channel estimates, derived by the channel processor 594 from a reference signal transmitted by the Node B 510 or from feedback contained in the midamble transmitted by the Node B 510, may be used to select the appropriate coding, modulation, spreading, and/or scrambling schemes. The symbols produced by the transmit processor 580 will be provided to a transmit frame processor 582 to create a frame structure. The transmit frame processor 582 creates this frame structure by multiplexing the symbols with information from the controller/processor 590, resulting in a series of frames. The frames are then provided to a transmitter 556, which provides various signal conditioning functions including amplification, filtering, and modulating the frames onto a carrier for uplink transmission over the wireless medium through the antenna 552.\nThe uplink transmission is processed at the Node B 510 in a manner similar to that described in connection with the receiver function at the UE 550. A receiver 535 receives the uplink transmission through the antenna 534 and processes the transmission to recover the information modulated onto the carrier. The information recovered by the receiver 535 is provided to a receive frame processor 536, which parses each frame, and provides information from the frames to the channel processor 544 and the data, control, and reference signals to a receive processor 538. The receive processor 538 performs the inverse of the processing performed by the transmit processor 580 in the UE 550. The data and control signals carried by the successfully decoded frames may then be provided to a data sink 539 and the controller/processor, respectively. If some of the frames were unsuccessfully decoded by the receive processor, the controller/processor 540 may also use an acknowledgement (ACK) and/or negative acknowledgement (NACK) protocol to support retransmission requests for those frames.\nThe controller/processors 540 and 590 may be used to direct the operation at the Node B 510 and the UE 550, respectively. For example, the controller/processors 540 and 590 may provide various functions including timing, peripheral interfaces, voltage regulation, power management, and other control functions. The computer readable media of memories 542 and 592 may store data and software for the Node B 510 and the UE 550, respectively. A scheduler/processor 546 at the Node B 510 may be used to allocate resources to the UEs and schedule downlink and/or uplink transmissions for the UEs.\nSeveral aspects of a telecommunications system have been presented with reference to a W-CDMA system. As those skilled in the art will readily appreciate, various aspects described throughout this disclosure may be extended to other telecommunication systems, network architectures and communication standards.\nBy way of example, various aspects may be extended to other UMTS systems such as TD-SCDMA, High Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA), High Speed Uplink Packet Access (HSUPA), High Speed Packet Access Plus (HSPA+) and TD-CDMA. Various aspects may also be extended to systems employing Long Term Evolution (LTE) (in FDD, TDD, or both modes), LTE-Advanced (LTE-A) (in FDD, TDD, or both modes), CDMA2000, Evolution-Data Optimized (EV-DO), Ultra Mobile Broadband (UMB), IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi), IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX), IEEE 802.20, Ultra-Wideband (UWB), Bluetooth, and/or other suitable systems. The actual telecommunication standard, network architecture, and/or communication standard employed will depend on the specific application and the overall design constraints imposed on the system.\nIn accordance with various aspects of the disclosure, an element, or any portion of an element, or any combination of elements may be implemented with a “processing system” that includes one or more processors. Examples of processors include microprocessors, microcontrollers, digital signal processors (DSPs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), programmable logic devices (PLDs), state machines, gated logic, discrete hardware circuits, and other suitable hardware configured to perform the various functionality described throughout this disclosure. One or more processors in the processing system may execute software.

The software may reside on a computer-readable medium. The computer-readable medium may be a non-transitory computer-readable medium. A non-transitory computer-readable medium includes, by way of example, a magnetic storage device (e.g., hard disk, floppy disk, magnetic strip), an optical disk (e.g., compact disk (CD), digital versatile disk (DVD)), a smart card, a flash memory device (e.g., card, stick, key drive), random access memory (RAM), read only memory (ROM), programmable ROM (PROM), erasable PROM (EPROM), electrically erasable PROM (EEPROM), a register, a removable disk, and any other suitable medium for storing software and/or instructions that may be accessed and read by a computer. The computer-readable medium may also include, by way of example, a carrier wave, a transmission line, and any other suitable medium for transmitting software and/or instructions that may be accessed and read by a computer. The computer-readable medium may be resident in the processing system, external to the processing system, or distributed across multiple entities including the processing system. The computer-readable medium may be embodied in a computer-program product. By way of example, a computer-program product may include a computer-readable medium in packaging materials. Those skilled in the art will recognize how best to implement the described functionality presented throughout this disclosure depending on the particular application and the overall design constraints imposed on the overall system.\nIt is to be understood that the specific order or hierarchy of steps in the methods disclosed is an illustration of exemplary processes. Based upon design preferences, it is understood that the specific order or hierarchy of steps in the methods may be rearranged.

Various modifications to these aspects will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art, and the generic principles defined herein may be applied to other aspects. Thus, the claims are not intended to be limited to the aspects shown herein, but is to be accorded the full scope consistent with the language of the claims, wherein reference to an element in the singular is not intended to mean “one and only one” unless specifically so stated, but rather “one or more.” Unless specifically stated otherwise, the term “some” refers to one or more. A phrase referring to “at least one of” a list of items refers to any combination of those items, including single members. As an example, “at least one of: a, b, or c” is intended to cover: a; b; c; a and b; a and c; b and c; and a, b and c.

        "modeForInvention": "SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION[0007] In one embodiment, a method for adaptively invoking partial packet decoding may involve the following operations. The method may be performed by a User Equipment (UE) device (also referred to as a communication device) such as a mobile phone or mobile device when receiving packets from a base station.[0008] The communication device may determine whether a first measure of quality of a communication link (i.e., a wireless link with the base station) is better than a first quality standard in response to the start of a transmission period or interval for a current packet. The first measure of quality may be based, e.g., on block error rate or bit error rate. The first measure may be a measure that has been computed based on previously received packets. The determination of whether the first measure of quality is better than the first quality standard is used to determine if partial packet decoding should be enabled, i.e., to determine whether the possibility of partial packet decoding should be investigated. If the first measure of quality is not better than the first quality standard, then the method determines that power should not be wasted on partial packet decoding, and partial packet decoding is disabled.[0009] In response to determining that the first measure of quality is better than the first quality standard, then partial packet decoding is enabled. When partial packet decoding is enabled, the communication device may: obtain a second measure of the quality of the communication link; determine whether the second measure of the quality of the communication link is better than a second quality standard; and perform a partial packet decoding process on the current packet until the end of the current packet in response to determining that the second measure is better than the second quality standard.[0010] There are a wide variety of possibilities for the second measure of quality. For example, the second measure of quality may be based on a signal to noise ratio (or, a signal to interference ratio, or, a signal to interference-and-noise ratio) associated with the communication link. The second measure of quality may be derived from information contained in the current packet, in associated control information that is sent to the communication device for decoding the packet, and/or in other channels (e.g., pilot channel of which transmit power and transmit sequence is known).[0011] If the first measure of quality is not better than the first quality standard or the second measure of quality is not better than the second quality standard, the communication device may disable partial packet decoding, wait until the end of the current packet, and invoke packet decoding based on the fully-received contents of the current packet.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS[0012] A better understanding of the present invention can be obtained when the following detailed description of the embodiments is considered in conjunction with the following drawings.[0013] FIG. 1 illustrates an exemplary (and simplified) wireless communication system;[0014] FIG. 2 illustrates a base station 102 in communication with user equipment 106;[0015] FIG. 3 illustrates an exemplary block diagram of a user equipment device, according to one embodiment;[0016] FIG. 4 is a flowchart for one embodiment of a method for selectively enabling a partial packet decoding process, based on block error rate and signal to noise ratio;[0017] FIG. 5 is a flowchart for one embodiment of a method for selectively enabling a partial packet decoding process, based on block error rate and a composite of a signal to noise ratio and a number of power control DOWN commands;[0018] FIG. 6 is a flowchart showing one embodiment of a method for controlling the performance of a partial packet decoding process, based on two link quality tests; and[0019] FIG. 7 illustrates the structure of a slot for the Dedicated Physical Channel (DPCH) in UTMS.[0020] While the invention is susceptible to various modifications and alternative forms, specific embodiments thereof are shown by way of example in the drawings and are herein described in detail.

The base station 102 may also be equipped to communicate with a network 100. Thus, the base statation 102 may facilitate communication between the user devices and/or between the user devices and the network 100. When the communication system conforms to the UTMS standard, the base station 102 may be referred to as the “NodeB”. UTMS is a third generation (3G) mobile cellular technology.[0054] The base station 102 and the UE devices may be configured to communicate over the transmission medium using any of various wireless communication technologies such as GSM, CDMA, WLL, WAN, WiFi, WiMAX etc.[0055] FIG. 2 illustrates user equipment (UE) 106 (e.g., one of the devices 106-1 through 106-N) in communication with the base station 102.

In some embodiments, the MMU 240 may be included as a portion of the processor(s) 202.[0058] In the embodiment shown, ROM 250 may include a bootloader 252, which may be executed by the processor(s) 202 during boot up or initialization. As also shown, the SOC 200 may be coupled to various other circuits of the UE 106. For example, the UE 106 may include various types of memory (e.g., including NAND flash 210), a connector interface 220 (e.g., for coupling to the computer system), the display 240, and wireless communication circuitry (e.g., for LTE, CDMA2000, Bluetooth, WiFi, etc.).[0059] The UE device 106 may include at least one antenna, and in some embodiments multiple antennas, for performing wireless communication with base stations. For example, the UE device 106 may use antennas 235 and 237 to perform the wireless communication. The UE 106 may be configured to communicate wirelessly using multiple (e.g., at least two) radio access technologies (RATs).[0060] As shown, the UE 106 may include a SIM (Subscriber Identity Module) 310, which may also be referred to as a smart card. The SIM 310 may take the form of a removable SIM card. As one example, the SIM 310 may be a Universal Integrated Circuit Card (UICC) 310. In some embodiments, the SIM 310 may store a preferred roaming list (PRL) which is used for roaming on various telecommunication networks.[0061] The processor 202 of the UE device 106 may be configured to implement part or all of the methods described herein, e.g., by executing program instructions stored on a memory medium (e.g., a non-transitory computer-readable memory medium). In other embodiments, processor 202 may be configured as programmable hardware element, such as an FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array), or as an ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit).FIG. 4[0062] FIG. 4 is a flowchart diagram of one embodiment of a method for performing adaptive partial packet decoding. This method is performed by the UE 106.[0063] At 402, the transmission time interval (TTI) starts for a current packet. When the TTI starts, the UE 106 performs the following operations.[0064] At 404, the method evaluates a first condition for enabling partial packet decoding (PPD) on the current packet. The first condition may be based on a Block Error Rate (BLER). More specifically, the method determines if the BLER is less than a BLER Threshold (THBLER). If not, then partial packet decoding is not used for the current packet as indicated at 406. Thus, at 404 the method effectively implements a BLER-based PPD gating condition. In a power-controlled downlink channel, its BLER is updated every packet (or TTI) by the UE 106, and the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) target is adjusted based on the current BLER. The BLER is thus used as a gating criterion for partial packet decoding. If BLER<THBLER in the current packet TTI, then control passes to 408. In an alternative embodiment, the Bit Error Rate (BER) may be used instead of BLER. Any of various other methods or techniques may be used to assess the quality of the communication link as a gating condition for applying PPD.[0065] If the Block Error Rate (BLER) is less than the BLER Threshold (THBLER), then the method advances to 408.[0066] At 408, the method measures a Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) for the first x milliseconds of the current packet. (In alternative embodiments, SIR or SINR may be measured instead of SNR.) In different embodiments, the value x may have different values in the range, e.g., from 2 to 18 milliseconds in UMTS. For example, the value x may have different values anywhere in the range from 1-5 to 15-20 milliseconds. In some embodiments, the first x milliseconds may cover a given fractional portion of the packet. The given fractional portion may range from, e.g., 30% to 70% of the packet. For example, the given fractional portion may range anywhere from 20-40% to 60-80%. In some embodiments, the method may make a plurality of SNR measurements during the first x milliseconds, and filter the SNR measurements with a digital filter (e.g., an IIR filter). For example, the packet may include a plurality of slots, and an SNR may be determined for each of the slots occurring in the first x milliseconds. The slot SNRs may then be filtered.[0067] In one embodiment, the filter is an IIR filter of the form:          yn=(1−α)*yn-1+α*SNRn,where SNRn denotes the nth SNR measurement of the first x milliseconds, where α is a positive constant that is less than one. The filter output value yn may also be denoted by fIIR(SNRn). The IIR filter may be initialized with y0=0 (or with y0=SNR0). Any of various other filter structures may be used.[0068] At 410, the method may evaluate a second condition for enabling partial packet decoding on the current packet. In one embodiment, the second condition is based on the SNR (or SIR or SINR) measured at 408, e.g., based on the output value of the above-described filter at the end of the first x milliseconds. (The measured SNR represents a short term measure of link quality whereas the BLER represents a longer term measure of link quality.) In the power-controlled downlink channel, the UE 106 compares the measured SNR with the current SNR target for the downlink channel. For example, if fIIR(SNR)-SNRtarget>THSNR, then link quality is declared to be good enough so that partial packet decoding may be enabled until the end of the current packet as indicated at 412. (With partial packet encoding being enabled, the UE may make one or more attempts to decode the packet. Each attempt may be based on the amount of the packet data that has accumulated up to the time of the attempt. Of course, if a given attempt is successful (e.g., as indicated by a successful CRC test), no further attempt need be made.)[0069] Conversely, if fIIR(SNR)-SNRtarget<THSNR, then partial packet decoding is disabled for the current packet as indicated at 414. After the current packet is fully received, a decoding based on the fully-received contents of the current packet is performed.[0070] Any of various measures of link quality may be measured at 408 and used at 410 instead of (or, in addition to) SNR. For example, in various embodiments, one or more (or, two or more, or all) of the following conditions may be used.[0071] 1) Power Control command-based: The number of DOWN commands in the past N power control commands is larger than a threshold M.[0072] 2) CPICH SNR-based: fIIR(CPICH_SNR)>THCPICH—SNR, where CPICH_SNR is the SNR derived from the Common Pilot Channel (CPICH).[0073] 3) TPC-SNR based: fIIR(UL_TPC_SNR)>THULTPC—SNR, where UL_TPC_SNR is an SNR associated with the Uplink TPC that is sent through the DL channel, e.g., Dedicated Physical Control Channel (DPCCH) in UMTS, which is time-domain multiplexed (TDMed) with DPDCH.[0074] With respect to condition 2) above, it is noted that THCPICH—SNR can be dynamically updated considering zero, one or more factors, e.g., the relation between CPICH code power and DPCCH code power, and/or target SNR for downlink power control. “Code power” means the amount of transmit power allocated to a specific physical layer code channel.[0075] With respect to condition 3) above, THUL—TPC—SNR can be dynamically updated considering zero, one or more other factors, e.g., the relation between UL_TPC power and the power of a dedicated pilot, e.g., dedicated pilot power in DPCCH in UMTS, and/or target SNR for downlink power control.[0076] FIG. 5 shows an alternative embodiment of the method for performing adaptive partial packet decoding. At 408*, instead of SNR, the UE measures fIIR(CPICH_SNR). At 410*, the UE evaluates the logical AND of the condition          fIIR(CPICH—SNR)>THCPICH—SNRand the condition that the number of DOWN commands in the past N power control commands is larger than M. The remaining steps of this alternative embodiment are similar to the like numbered steps of the FIG. 4 embodiment.[0077] FIG. 6 illustrates one embodiment of a method for controlling the performance of partial packet decoding based on two measures of link quality. The method may be performed by the user equipment 106 of a communication system. See, e.g., FIGS. 1 and 2. The method may include any subset of the features described above in connection with FIGS. 1-5.[0078] At 610, the user equipment may determine whether a first measure of quality of a communication link is better than a first quality standard in response to a start of a transmission interval for a current packet. The first measure of quality may be block error rate or bit error rate, or any other desired measure.[0079] At 615, the user equipment may perform the operations 620-630 in response to determining that the first measure of quality is better than the first quality standard.[0080] At 620, the user equipment may obtain a second measure of the quality of the communication link. The second measure of quality may be any of those measures discussed above or any logical combination of those measures. The second measure may be a measure derived from the current packet, e.g., an initial portion of the current packet.[0081] At 625, the user equipment may determine whether the second measure of the quality of the communication link is better than a second quality standard. The determination may take the form of an inequality test, as variously described above.[0082] At 630, the user equipment may perform a partial packet decoding process on the current packet (until the end of the current packet) in response to determining that the second measure is better than the second quality standard. The partial packet decoding process may be performed as variously described above.[0083] In some embodiments, the second measure of quality is a signal to noise ratio (SNR) of associated with the communication link. Alternatively, the second measure may be a signal to interference ratio (SIR) or a signal to interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) of associated with the communication link.[0084] In some embodiments, the second measure includes a number of power control DOWN commands transmitted to the base station. See, e.g., FIG. 5.[0085] In some embodiments, the second measure of quality is based on information contained in the current packet, e.g., in the first x milliseconds of the current packet as described above.[0086] In some embodiments, the partial packet decoding process on the current packet may include making one or more attempts to decode the current packet. Each of the one or more attempts is based on an amount of data of the current packet that has been received up to the time of the attempt.[0087] In some embodiments, the partial packet decoding process is performed after waiting a predetermined amount of time from the start of the transmission interval, e.g., as variously described above. The predetermined amount of time is selected so that an effective coding rate of a received portion of the current packet after the predetermined amount of time is less than one.[0088] In some embodiments, the action of obtaining the second measure of quality includes obtaining measurements for a predetermined amount of time from the start of the transmission interval, where the predetermined amount of time is selected so that an effective coding rate of a received portion of the current packet after the predetermined amount of time is less than one.Downlink Power Control in UMTS[0089] A. DTCH-Inner Loop PC (ILPC)[0090] In some embodiments, in every slot (there are 15 slots in a 10 ms frame) a dedicated pilot is sent to the UE to measure received SIR. FIG. 7 shows one embodiment for the structure of a slot. The measured SIR may be compared against an SIR target that is derived from measured BLER. If SIR<SIRtarget, then the UE sends an UP(+) command to the base station 102; otherwise it sends a DOWN(−) command to the base station 102. The UP command directs the base station to increase the power of its transmissions on the DL channel, e.g., DPDCH and DPCCH in UMTS. The DOWN command directs the base station to decrease the power of its transmissions on the DL channel, e.g., DPDCH and DPCCH in UMTS. One TPC command is sent from UE to the base station for every slot.[0091] B. DTCH-Outer Loop PC (OLPC)[0092] If BLER>BLERtarget, then the UE increases its SIRtarget by an amount ΔPlus in dB; otherwise the UE decreases its SIRtarget by an amount ΔMinus in dB. The parameters ΔPlus and ΔMinus may be selected to achieve a desired BLER. For example, Δplus=1 dB and Δminus=0.01 dB may be used to achieve a 1% BLER (i.e., one CRC error out of 100 packets). In practice, if there is no CRC error, OLPC keeps on stepping down SIRtarget by 0.01 dB. When a CRC error happens, SIRtarget is increased by 1 dB.[0093] The BLER may be updated every TTI. (The TTI is 20 ms for DTCH in UMTS.) Whenever the BLER is updated, SIRtarget may also be updated.[0094] Embodiments of the present invention may be realized in any of various forms. For example, in some embodiments, the present invention may be realized as a computer-implemented method, a computer-readable memory medium, or a computer system. In other embodiments, the present invention may be realized using one or more custom-designed hardware devices such as ASICs. In other embodiments, the present invention may be realized using one or more programmable hardware elements such as FPGAs.[0095] In some embodiments, a non-transitory computer-readable memory medium may be configured so that it stores program instructions and/or data, where the program instructions, if executed by a computer system, cause the computer system to perform a method, e.g., any of a method embodiments described herein, or, any combination of the method embodiments described herein, or, any subset of any of the method embodiments described herein, or, any combination of such subsets.[0096] In some embodiments, a computer system may be configured to include a processor (or a set of processors) and a memory medium, where the memory medium stores program instructions, where the processor is configured to read and execute the program instructions from the memory medium, where the program instructions are executable to implement any of the various method embodiments described herein (or, any combination of the method embodiments described herein, or, any subset of any of the method embodiments described herein, or, any combination of such subsets).

        "modeForInvention": "SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\nThe invention improves the efficiency of transmission over a wireless packet network. In the invention, packet transmission deferrals and packet collisions are balanced to determine favorable values of a transmitter's carrier sense defer threshold, and a transmitter's transmit power level.In general, the invention features a method for transmission of an information packet over a transmission channel. In one illustrative embodiment, the method includes the steps of computing a current value of a transmission control parameter, based at least in part on a ratio between counts of transmission events of first and second event classes, and transmitting the packet over the transmission channel in accordance with the computed parameter.Particular embodiments of the invention may further feature the following. The transmission control parameter may be a carrier-sense defer threshold; transmission of the packet is deferred until the carrier strength observed on the channel falls below this threshold. Alternatively, the parameter may be a transmit power level. The two event classes are selected from a group consisting of recent packet transmission successes, recent packet collisions, and recent packet deferrals on the transmission channel. Other embodiments may use ratios between all three of recent packet transmission successes, recent packet collisions, and recent packet deferrals on the transmission channel. The transmission control parameter may be computed by adding a first delta value to the control parameter in response to observation of an event in the first event class, and by adding a second delta value to the parameter in response to observation of an event in the second event class. Here, the first and second delta values are chosen in a ratio to each other reflecting a desired future ratio of the first and second event classes. The transmission control parameter may be further based on an observed channel path-loss characteristic between the transmitter and the receiver, determined with reference to a transmit power level encoded in a packet previously received from the receiver. The transmission control parameter is computed by a method chosen to obtain a desired future ratio between network transmission events of the first and second classes, for instance to obtain a desired ratio between future packet transmission successes and future packet collisions.Embodiments of the invention may provide one or more of the following advantages. The invention allows much higher reuse of the transmission medium--that is, more packets can be in transmission simultaneously. The invention reduces packet collisions, including those produced by the hidden transmitter problem. Transmission delays, for instance those caused by packet deferrals, are reduced. The invention eases use of the network--more of the required \"tuning\" is performed automatically, and therefore less manual intervention is required. This automatic tuning is relatively stable--the network will stabilize in a high-throughput condition, even when starting in a far-from-optimum configuration.Further features and advantages of the invention are described in the figures and following detailed description.DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGFIG. 1 is a schematic representation of a prior art wireless network having multiple transmitting and receiving stations.FIG. 2 is a schematic representation of a wireless network configured according to the invention.FIG. 3 is a block diagram of a receiving station within a network of the present invention.FIG. 4 is a flow chart for a method of transmitting packets according to the invention.FIG. 5 is a plot of adaptive carrier sense defer threshold against time.FIG. 6 is an illustration of a data packet.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTSReferring to FIG. 2, in the invention, the transmit power levels and carrier sense defer thresholds of each of a plurality of transmitters have been put under adaptive control. As packets are transmitted, each transmitter adapts its power level and carrier sense defer threshold as explained below. In the scenario of FIG. 1, the invention allows all five packets to transmit simultaneously, with no collisions.Because the T.sub.2 -R.sub.2 link is short, T.sub.2 's power level has been adaptively reduced (indicated by the reduced diameter of circle 204), so that the T.sub.2 -R.sub.2 packet does not interfere with R.sub.5 's receipt of the T.sub.5 -R.sub.5 packet. Similarly, T.sub.3 's power level has been adaptively reduced (indicated by the reduced diameter of circle 206) and T.sub.4 's carrier sense defer threshold has been adaptively raised (indicated by the reduced diameter of circle 208) so that T.sub.4 need not defer to the T.sub.3 -R.sub.3 packet. The invention thus allows five packets to proceed simultaneously where only three successful simultaneous packets were possible in the conventional arrangement of FIG. 1.FIG. 3 shows a station 300 of a wireless network such as the network of FIG. 2. Station 300 includes a transmitter portion 302 and a receiver portion 304. In preparing to transmit a packet, transmitter portion 302 uses receiver portion 304 to do the carrier sense 'listening.' In receiver portion 304, antenna 310 collects ambient electromagnetic radiation 312. RF (radio frequency) frontend 320 bandpass filters the frequency band of interest, and amplifies any signal in that band. Signal 322, the RSSI (received signal strength indicator) signal, tells how much amplification was required to bring the received signal up to the level provided to the rest of the receiver. Demodulator 330, carrier detector 332, and carrier sense decision unit 334 together analyze the received signal wave. This analysis determines whether the radiation received by antenna 310 constitutes a signal of strength and quality sufficient for receipt of a packet transmitted by another transmitter, or warrants deferral of a packet to be transmitted by transmitter 302. For example, carrier sense decision unit 334 might implement a function \"RSSI 322 is greater than a threshold, and carrier sense level 336 is TRUE.\" Data decision unit 338 receives the output of demodulator 330 and decodes the received analog wave form produced by demodulator 330 into digital values.In transmitter portion 302, control signal 340 from carrier sense decision unit 334 controls transmit buffer 342, telling the buffer to hold bits in storage and to wait until no carrier is sensed. Transmit power level 344 is developed by carrier sense decision and transmit power control unit 334. Signal 344 controls transmitter 346 to determine the power level at which a packet will be transmitted by antenna 310. Modulator 348 converts the bits stored in transmit buffer 342 into a wave form for transmission by transmitter 346. Controller 360 coordinates receiver 302 and transmitter 304 over bus 362.Referring to FIG. 4, in a receiver (300 of FIG. 3) according to the invention, the carrier sense decision and transmit power control unit (334 of FIG. 3) implements, an adaptive method 400 for setting the carrier sense defer threshold and transmit power levels. In summary, the method of FIG. 4 maintains two baseline values, a baseline carrier sense defer threshold and a baseline transmit power level, adjusting these values up and down in accord with the transmitter's experience of packet successes, failures, and deferrals. Further adjustments to the carrier sense defer threshold and power level are based on the channel path gain between transmitter and receiver.FIG. 4 shows actions actively taken by the system as boxes and solid arrows. Passive, asynchronous actions, of the \"wait until something happens\" variety, are shown by ovals and dashed arrows.As part of the process of station power-up, the baseline carrier sense defer threshold and baseline transmit power levels are set to default values (steps not shown in FIG. 4).When transmitter 302 receives a packet from controller 360 to transmit (step 410), the carrier sense defer threshold and transmit power level are computed by adjusting the baseline values by a value related to the path gain from transmitter to receiver (this adjusting in step 600 is discussed in detail below in connection with FIG. 6). In step 420, the carrier sense level (336 of FIG. 3, computed in step 460, discussed below) is compared to the current carrier sense defer threshold. When the carrier sense level is greater than the carrier sense defer threshold, then the receiver has determined that there is another transmitter currently active, and that the current packet should be deferred. Once the deferral decision has been taken (arrow 422), then steps 424 and 426 implement the adaptive modification of the control parameters before the actual deferral occurs in step 480. Step 424 increases the baseline carrier sense defer threshold by a value .delta..sub.cad, thereby decreasing the sensitivity of the carrier sensing circuitry to other packet transmissions and decreasing the likelihood that the next attempt will be deferred. Step 426 decreases the transmit power level by a value .delta..sub.pd. The deferral is accomplished by placing the transmitter in a collision avoidance wait (step 480), discussed below.If, in step 420, the sensed carrier level 336 was less than the current carrier sense defer threshold, then (arrow 430) the packet is transmitted (step 432). The transmitter control then enters a wait (step 434), awaiting receipt of an acknowledgement from the receiver.Wait 434 ends on one of three asynchronous events. The wait can end unsuccessfully (arrow 436) by receipt of a negative acknowledgment (\"NACK\"), or a timeout (no acknowledgement received within a specified time). Alternatively, the wait can end successfully (arrow 438) by receipt of an acknowledgement from the receiver.If wait 434 fails (arrow 436), then the transmitter infers (step 440) that there was a collision between another packet (transmitted by another transmitter) and the packet transmitted in step 432. In step 442, the baseline carrier sense defer threshold is decreased by a value .delta..sub.cse (thereby increasing the sensitivity of the carrier sensing circuitry to other transmissions and the likelihood that future packets will be deferred, reducing the likelihood of future collisions). In step 444, the baseline transmit power level is increased by a value .delta..sub.pc. The delay window for the collision avoidance wait is increased, typically by multiplying it by a factor. The system enters the collision avoidance wait of step 480, discussed below.If wait 434 ends (arrow 438) with the receipt (step 450) of an acknowledgment of successful receipt of the packet, then step 452 increases the baseline carrier sense defer threshold by a value .delta..sub.cas and decreases the baseline transmit power level by a value .delta..sub.ps. Current carrier sense level 336 (FIG. 3) is then sampled (step 454). If the sampled carrier sense level 336 is less than the baseline carrier sense defer threshold (indicating that no other packet is in progress), then step 456 resets the collision avoidance window to a default value or to a value randomly chosen from a uniform random variable. The window reset value or random variable and multiplication factor of step 444 are jointly chosen so that the average delay will be in the neighborhood of five packet times. The system then enters its idle state (step 460).During idle state 460, the receiver continuously monitors the carrier sense level (336 of FIG. 3), and transmitter 304 awaits a next packet to transmit from controller 360. When such a packet arrives (an asynchronous event indicated by dotted line 462), method 400 repeats, starting at step 410. During transmitter idle state (step 460), the receiver continuously monitors the ambient electromagnetic radiation to determine an energy level of the carrier. The carrier sense level (336 of FIG. 3) continuously reflects this monitored signal strength. Thus, when a packet is received for transmission, method 400 can immediately exit wait 400 (arrow 462) and begin work at steps 600 and 420. It is not necessary to wait to listen for a packet already in progress--the listening was performed passively during wait 460.During collision avoidance wait 480, receiver 302 continuously monitors the carrier sense level (336 of FIG. 3). Wait 480 is terminated on any one of several wakeup conditions. Wakeup 482 may occur when carrier sense level 336 drops below a threshold (typically the carrier sense defer threshold computed in step 600), or when the timeout window elapses. In an alternative embodiment, wakeup 482 may only occur when both the collision avoidance timeout elapses and the carrier sense value 336 falls below a threshold. The choice among these alternatives is made by the programmer, and may vary depending on the path by which wait 480 was entered (e.g., by deferral on path 422-424-426 or by collision on path 440-442-444).After wakeup 482, the method loops back to step 600, where the carrier sense defer threshold and transmit power level are recomputed. After testing carrier sense level 336 against the new threshold in step 420, packet transmit may be retried in step 432 or further deferred in steps 424 and 480.The values .delta..sub.csd, .delta..sub.pd, .delta..sub.cse, .delta..sub.pe, .delta..sub.css, .delta..sub.ps (steps 424, 426, 442, 444 and 452) are parameters that can be configured in each transmitter to optimize the transmitter to its environment. Values for the .delta.'s may be selected as follows. It has been observed in a computer model of a wireless network that improved performance is achieved when the ratio of successful packet transmissions to collisions is between about 4:1 and 10:1. Assuming a steady state where the transmitters and receivers are stationary and many packets are exchanged between individual transmitter/receiver pairs, this success:collision ratio is achieved by setting the .delta.'s in the desired packet event ratios. For instance, setting.delta..sub.css :.delta..sub.csc =.delta..sub.ps :.delta..sub.pe .apprxeq.5will maintain network events at a success:collision ratio of 5 (in the equilibrium state). The exact values chosen for the .delta.'s will depend on environmental characteristics, such as the existence of reflections, obstructions, the anticipated rates of change in signal strength due to motion of stations, the importance of reaching the equilibrium baseline values in a minimum of packet transmissions weighed against the importance of stability of the equilibrium value once achieved, etc.The computer model predicts that the success:collision ratio is more important to control than the success:deferral ratio. Therefore, the dependence of the power level and carrier sense defer threshold should depend much less strongly on deferrals than on collisions. Thus .delta..sub.csd will be less than .delta..sub.csc, and .delta..sub.pd will be less than .delta..sub.pe.It is desirable that the .delta.'s express signal power level and carrier sense defer threshold in dB units, so that power level and carrier sense defer threshold depend exponentially on the arithmetic values of the baseline variables maintained by the additions and subtractions of FIG. 4.Any of the subtractions of steps 426, 444, and 452 could be changed to additions (or any of the additions changed to subtractions), so long as the sign of the corresponding .delta. value is changed as well.As shown in FIG. 5, a computer simulation of the method of FIG. 4 reaches a fairly stable equilibrium where the carrier sense defer threshold .apprxeq.-8 dB. By managing the ratios of successful, colliding, and deferred packets, the throughput of the network is improved. If too few packets collide, then the transmitters are being \"too polite\" and wasting channel capacity by deferring; if too many collide, then capacity is lost to retransmission. The method of FIG. 4 achieves a balance between these extremes. Throughput values as high as 1.8 can be achieved (measuring the average number of packets simultaneously in transmission within a conventional transmission cell, the circles of FIG. 1); the conventional arrangement of FIG. 1 has 1.0 as a bound on the highest achievable throughput.It should be noted that the embodiment of FIG. 4 computes values representative of ratios of event populations, even though the method never computes a count of events, nor does it divide one event count by another. The counter-balancing additions and subtractions of steps 424, 426, 442, 444, and 452 nonetheless compute a value closely correlated to the ratios of events. For instance, the peaks 502 of the curve correspond to points at which the recent event population has included a relatively high ratio of deferrals and successes (steps 424, 426, and 452) to failures (steps 442 and 444). The valleys 504 indicate points at which there has been a relatively high ratio of failures to deferrals and successes.Tests other than those disclosed could be used to determine the events on which to increment and decrement the baseline carrier sense defer threshold and baseline transmit power level. In the FIG. 4 embodiment, only packets sent from or intended for receipt by the station in question are used to increment and decrement these two values. In an alternative embodiment, the values could be incremented and decremented in response to messages observed but intended for other stations. This would allow adaptation during idle wait (460 of FIG. 4), similar to the \"snooping\" described in the discussion of FIG. 6.In other alternatives, values representative of event ratios could be computed by \"decaying tail\" computations. For instance, in step 424, the carrier sense defer threshold could be multiplied by a first constant, typically a value between 0.5 and 1.0, and then a second constant added. In step 442, the carrier sense defer threshold could be multiplied by a third constant, and a fourth added. In step 452, the carrier sense defer threshold could be multiplied by a fifth constant, and a sixth added.Alternatively, values tracking each of deferrals, failures, and successes could be maintained using a decaying tail computation at steps 424, 442, and 452, respectively. Then step 600 would proceed by dividing the appropriate pairs of decaying tail representations, and possibly further adjusting the quotient for the path gain.In yet another alternative, \"moving averages\" of recent event ratios could be maintained. In these embodiments, steps 424, 426, 442, 444 and 452 would involve incrementing an event count for the most-recently observed event, and decrementing the count corresponding to the oldest event in the moving average. The system could maintain a queue recording the one hundred most recent events. In these embodiments, step 600 of FIG. 4 would involve dividing the event counts to compute event ratios, and possibly further adjusting the value based on the path gain.Referring now to FIG. 6, the path gain used in step 600 of FIG. 4 is computed with reference to a transmitter ID 612 and transmit power level 614 that are encoded into each transmitted packet 610. (The packet also includes a header portion 161 to calibrate the receiver's carrier recovery and timing recovery, and a message portion 618, containing the data bits to be conveyed from transmitter to receiver.) Before each packet is transmitted (step 432 of FIG. 4), the transmit power level is computed in step 600, fed to the transmitter frontend by signal 344 of FIG. 3, and stored in field 614 of packet 610. The receiver of the packet divides the received signal strength (RSSI signal 322 of FIG. 3) as the packet is received by the transmit power level 614 encoded in the packet. (If the power level is encoded in dB logarithmic units, this division can be carried out by subtracting the values.) From the division quotient the receiver can estimate the signal attenuation of the path channel. The path attenuation determined is stored in a memory, in association with the transmitter ID 612 of the station that transmitted the packet.When a packet is to be transmitted, step 600 retrieves the recipient's path gain from the memory and computes the carrier sense defer threshold and transmit power level as a positive or negative adjustment from the baseline values, depending on the path gain determined for the corresponding receiver station. A nearby station will have a high path gain (low attenuation); for packets to/from this nearby station, the adjustments of step 600 will produce a relatively low transmit power and a relatively high carrier sense defer threshold.In a more aggressive method to determine path gain, the receiver could \"snoop\" on all packets transmitted by other transmitters during transmitter idle (steps 460 and 480 of FIG. 4), and perform the same analysis of received signal strength indicator 322 against transmit power level 614 for all observed packets. This refinement is especially desirable in relatively \"gregarious\" networks where each transmitter station communicates with a relatively large proportion of the other nearby stations: during idle times, each station computes the defer threshold and power level it will use in future transmissions to other stations. In stations that communicate only with one other station (e.g., the satellite stations in a base station network), this refinement can be used to estimate a network average power level and carrier sense defer threshold, which in turn can be used to refine the calculations of an individual transmitter's power level and defer threshold.In an alternative refinement, especially useful in an environment where the stations are moving relatively rapidly, multiple values of path gain could be stored, with a time stamp associated with each stored path gain. Then, when the transmitter was computing a path gain (step 600 of FIG. 4), the stored path gains could be used to interpolate an estimate for the current path gain.It should be noted that path gain is not purely a function of distance: fading of path gain may also be induced by obstructions or destructive signal interference caused by reflections.The invention is advantageously used in any wireless network where spatial reuse of the channel is possible, for example in systems following the IEEE 802.11 and ETSI HIPERLAN standards.Referring again to FIG. 4, note that the method there disclosed causes control information to persist from packet to packet. This is in contrast to carrier sense schemes for non-reusable media, such as Ethernet, where the exponential backoff delay for a given packet is independent of the transmission history of previous packets. In the embodiment disclosed in FIG. 4, this persistence is achieved by adding the .delta.'s to the previous values of the control parameters, and by choosing the values of the .delta.'s so that the system achieves a semi-stable oscillating equilibrium. Alternative computations of the control parameters could be used, such as multiplying the previous value of the control parameter by a constant less than one, and combining that value with a newly-computed estimate of the optimal value of that parameter (thus forgetting the past in exponential decay).The transmit power level and carrier sense defer threshold are independent values, and the path gain computation and event ratio methods of computing these control parameters are independent methods. Though particularly favorable results are achieved by combining both methods to compute both parameters, an embodiment of the invention could use either one of the disclosed adaptive methods for one parameter, and another method to compute the other. For instance, the method of step 600 of FIG. 4 (discussed in connection with FIG. 6, above, adjusting carrier sense defer threshold and/or transmit power based on path gain estimation), can advantageously be used in conjunction with, or apart from, the method of the remainder of FIG. 4 (adjusting carrier sense defer threshold and/or transmit power level based on event ratios of packet successes, failures, and/or deferrals).It should be understood that the above description of the invention is merely illustrative and that many modifications and other embodiments are within the scope of the following claims.",

The aspects and features of the present invention and methods for achieving the aspects and features will be apparent by referring to the exemplary embodiments to be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. However, the present invention is not limited to the exemplary embodiments disclosed hereinafter, but can be implemented in diverse forms. The matters defined in the description, such as the detailed construction and elements, are nothing but specific details provided to assist those of ordinary skill in the art in a comprehensive understanding of the invention, and the present invention is only defined within the scope of the appended claims. In the entire description of the present invention, the same drawing reference numerals are used for the same elements across various figures.[0041] The present invention will be described herein with reference to the accompanying drawings illustrating block diagrams and flowcharts for explaining a UPnP-based network system and a control method thereof according to exemplary embodiments of the present invention. It will be understood that each block of the flowchart illustrations, and combinations of blocks in the flowchart illustrations, can be implemented by computer program instructions. These computer program instructions can be provided to a processor of a general purpose computer, special purpose computer, or other programmable data processing apparatus to produce a machine, such that the instructions, which execute via the processor of the computer or other programmable data processing apparatus, create means for implementing the functions specified in the flowchart block or blocks.[0042] These computer program instructions may also be stored in a computer usable or computer-readable memory that can direct a computer or other programmable data processing apparatus to function in a particular manner, such that the instructions stored in the computer usable or computer-readable memory produce an article of manufacture including instruction means that implement the function specified in the flowchart block or blocks.[0043] The computer program instructions may also be loaded onto a computer or other programmable data processing apparatus to cause a series of operational steps to be performed on the computer or other programmable apparatus to produce a computer implemented process such that the instructions that execute on the computer or other programmable apparatus provide steps for implementing the functions specified in the flowchart block or blocks.[0044] Also, each block of the flowchart illustrations may represent a module, segment, or portion of code, which comprises one or more executable instructions for implementing the specified logical function(s). It should also be noted that in some alternative implementations, the functions noted in the blocks may occur out of the depicted order. For example, two blocks shown in succession may in fact be executed substantially concurrently or the blocks may sometimes be executed in the reverse order, depending upon the functionality involved.[0045] FIG. 3 is a block diagram illustrating the construction of a UPnP-based network system according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.[0046] The UPnP-based network system according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention includes a control point (CP) 100 and a controlled device (CD) 200.[0047] The CP 100 serves to transmit a message capable of controlling the device.[0048] As illustrated in FIG. 3, the CP 100 includes a message control unit 110 and a cache data storage unit 120.[0049] The message control unit 110 serves to process various types of messages transmitted/received between the CP 100 and the CD 200. Messages that the CP 100 transmits to the CD 200 include a search message, a description request message, a control message, a subscription request message, and so forth, and messages that the CP 100 receives from the CD 200 include an advertisement message, a response message, an event message, and so forth.[0050] In the case of a UPnP-based network system according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the message control unit 110 of the CP 100 recognizes an extension header that is defined in the advertisement message transmitted from the CD 200 in the discovery step. This function will be described in detail in association with a discovery unit 210 of the CD 200 (described later).[0051] The cache data storage unit 120 stores cache data that includes information on the CD 200 transmitted from the CD 200. The information on the CD 200 included in the cache data may be information on the device, information on a service provided from the device, and so forth.[0052] The CD 200 provides an inherent service of the device in accordance with a control message transmitted from the CP 100.[0053] As illustrated in FIG. 3, the CD 200 includes a discovery unit 210, a description unit 220, a control unit 230, an eventing unit 240, and an information management unit 250.[0054] The discovery unit 210 serves to process a discovery message in the CD 200 in the discovery step.[0055] First, the discovery unit 210 transmits an advertisement message that includes device information and service information provided by the discovery unit 210. That is, when the CD 200 takes part in a network, it transmits the advertisement message containing basic information in order to notify the CP 100 of its existence. Here, the basic information includes a URL of description of a device that provides the CD 200, the type of device, an expiration time of a notification message, and so forth. The advertisement message may be transmitted by a multicast method.[0056] The extension header in the advertisement message transmitted from the CD 200 in the discovery step is defined in the UPnP-based network system according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.[0057] Generally, although a format of an advertisement message is defined by the standards, the advertisement message can be extended through a user's definition of the additional contents. Accordingly, the discovery unit 210 adds the extension header to the advertisement message, and includes information on the change of a service provided by the CD 200, i.e., information on the addition or deletion of the service, through the extension header.[0058] Thereafter, if a new service is added to the CD 200 or the existing service is deleted from the CD 200, the discovery unit 210 records service addition or deletion information through the extension header defined in the advertisement message. Also, if the advertisement message is transmitted to the CP 100, the message control unit 110 of the CP 100 recognizes the extension header defined in the advertisement message transmitted from the CD 200. Accordingly, in the case where the extension header defined in the advertisement message is changed, the CP 100 recognizes that the service provided from the CD 200 has been changed, and transmits a description request message to the CD 200 in order to receive a device description file and a service description file. In this case, the CD 200 transmits the device description file and the service description file to the CP 100.[0059] FIG. 4 is a view illustrating an example of an advertisement message in a UPnP-based network system according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.[0060] As illustrated in FIG. 4, the advertisement message includes a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) header containing information on a host, a cache control, a device URL, and so forth. Although the format of the advertisement message is defined as the standards, a user can extend the advertisement message by defining additional contents.[0061] Accordingly, the extension header that includes information on the addition or deletion of a service provided by the CD 200 can be defined in the advertisement message. In FIG. 4, an example of the extension header 211 called “SERVICE-CHANGE” is illustrated. The type of the extension header and information included in the extension header can be changed by those of ordinary skill in the art.[0062] In contrast, the advertisement message having the extension header may be generated at an initial stage where the CD 200 takes part in the network, or the extension header may be added to the standard advertisement message when the service provided from the CD 200 is added or deleted.[0063] In addition, the discovery unit 210 may transmit the advertisement message having the extension header to match the transmission period of a general advertisement message, or may transmit the advertisement message at a time when the service is added or deleted, regardless of the message transmission period.[0064] The CP 100 may transmit a search message for searching for the CD 200 to be used in a multicast method, and the discovery unit 210 may transmit a response message to the CP 100 if it corresponds to the CD 200 that the CP 100 is searching for. This response message may be transmitted by a unicast method.[0065] In contrast, the discovery unit 210 may use the Simple Service Discovery Protocol (SSDP) based on the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) header as a dynamic multicast discovery protocol between UPnP devices.[0066] The description unit 220 serves to generate a description file that includes information on a device and service of the CD 200 and to transmit the generated description file to the CP 100. In the UPnP network, a device description file and a service description file determined at the UPnP Forum may be used as the description files.[0067] The device description file is a document including information of the device and information on the service provided by the device, and includes information on a manufacturing company of the device, product information such as a model name and a serial number, and a list of services in the device, and so forth.[0068] In contrast, in the UPnP network, the device description file and the service description file may use an Extensible Markup Language (XML) format.[0069] The control unit 230 processes a command transmitted from the CP 100 in order for the CD 200 to use the service. That is, the control unit 230 serves to generate a response message to the request message of the CP 100 and to transmit the generated response message to the CP 100.[0070] In contrast, in the UPnP network, SOAP may be used as a control messaging protocol.[0071] The eventing unit 240 serves to generate an event message according to the state change of the service provided from the CD 200 and to transmit the generated event message to the CP 100.[0072] If the CP 100 intends to know the state change of the service provided from the CD 200, the CD 200 generates and transmits a subscription request message to the eventing URL included in the information on the CD 200 that is acquired at the discovery step. This step is called a subscription step. Thereafter, the CD 200 registers the CP 100 that has sent a registration request message, and if the state change of the service provided from the CD 200 or a specified eventing situation is generated, the CD 200 transmits the corresponding event message to the registered CP 100.[0073] In contrast, in the UPnP network, Generic Event Notification Architecture (GENA) based on the HTTP header may be used as a protocol for the eventing step of the device.[0074] The information management unit 250 serves to store and manage service information provided by the CD 200. At this time, the service information provided by the CD 200 may be stored in the form of a list. Also, the information management unit 250 can continuously update the service information list in accordance with the request transmitted from the CP 100.[0075] As described above, the UPnP-based network system may have a function of the CP 100 or the CD 200, or may have both functions of the CP 100 and the CD 200.[0076] Hereinafter, a method of controlling an UPnP-based network system as constructed above according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention will be described.[0077] FIG. 5 is a flowchart illustrating a process of recognizing addition or deletion of a service in a UPnP-based network system according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.[0078] First, for a predetermined period, the UPnP-based CD 200 transmits an advertisement message including its device information and service information that can be provided by the CD itself in a multicast method (S301). The advertisement message is in the form of an SSDP.[0079] At this time, the UPnP-based CP 100 receives the advertisement message, confirms the UDN of the CD 200 (S302), and then determines whether the CD, having sent the message, is identical to the existing CD 200 (S303).[0080] If the CP 100 determines that the CD 200, having sent the message, is a new CD 200 through the confirmation of the UDN in operation S303, the CP 100 transmits a description request message, i.e., an HTTP GET message to the CD 200 in order to receive a device description file and a service description file (S304). At this time, the CP 100 transmits the description request message through description URL information included in the advertisement message. Then, the CD 200 transmits the device description file and the service description file in XML format to the CP 100 in response to the description request message (S305).[0081] Then, the CP 100 stores the device information and the service information of the CD 200 in the cache data storage unit 120 by parsing the received device description file and service description file in XML format (S306).[0082] If the CP 100 determines that the CD 200, having sent the message, is identical to the existing CD 200 through the confirmation of the UDN in operation S303, the CP 100 determines whether the extension header defined in the advertisement message is changed (S307).[0083] If the extension header defined in the advertisement message is changed in operation S307, the CP 100 transmits the description request message to the CD 200 in order to receive the device description file and the service description file (S308). Then, the CD 200 transmits the device description files and the service description file in XML format to the CP 100 in response to the description request message (S309).[0084] Thereafter, the CP 100 updates the device information and the service information of the CD 200 by parsing the received device description file and service description file in XML format (S310).[0085] If it is determined that the extension header defined in the advertisement message is not changed in operation S307, the CP 100 does not download the device description file and the service description file of the corresponding CD 200, but performs only updating of the expiration time of the CD 200 stored in the cache data storage unit 120 (S311).[0086] As described above, in the UPnP-based network system according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the addition or deletion of the service can be recognized by defining the extension header in the advertisement message transmitted in the discovery step.[0087] FIG. 6 is an exemplary view explaining that the UPnP-based network system of FIG. 5 recognizes addition or deletion of a service at a discovery step according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.[0088] In FIG. 6, it is exemplified that the extension header defined in the advertisement message transmitted by the CD 200 is changed after the addition or deletion of the service. Even though the CP 100 determines that the CD 200 is identical to the existing CD 200 through the confirmation of the UDN (S302), the CP 100 can confirm the change of the extension header defined in the advertisement message (S307), and request and receive the device description file and the service description file from the CD 200 (S308 and S309).[0089] FIG. 7 is a block diagram illustrating the construction of a UPnP-based network system according to another exemplary embodiment of the present invention.[0090] The UPnP-based network system according to another exemplary embodiment of the present invention includes a CP 400 and a CD 500.[0091] As described above with reference to FIG. 3, the CP 400 includes a message control unit 410 and a cache data storage unit 420. That is, the message control unit 410 serves to process various types of messages transmitted from the CP 400 to the CD 500, and the cache data storage unit 420 serves to store cache data that includes information on the CD 500 transmitted from the CD 500.[0092] In the case of the UPnP-based network system according to another exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the message control unit 410 of the CP 400 is preset to request subscription of a description change advertisement service 560 included in the advertisement message transmitted from the CD 500 at the discovery step. This function will be described in detail in association with a description unit 520 of the CE 500 to be described later.[0093] The cache data storage unit 420 serves to store cache data that includes information on the CD 200 transmitted from the CD 200. The information on the CD 200 included in the cache data may be information on the device, information on a service provided from the device, and so forth.[0094] Also, the CD 500 includes a discovery unit 510, a description unit 520, a control unit 530, an eventing unit 540, and an information management unit 550. The control unit 530 and the information management unit 550 constituting the CD 500 of the UPnP-based network system according to another exemplary embodiment of the present invention are the same as those as described above with reference to FIG. 3, and thus the detailed description thereof will be omitted.[0095] The discovery unit 510 serves to process a discovery message in the CD 500 in the discovery step.[0096] First, the discovery unit 510 transmits an advertisement message that includes device information and service information that can be provided by the discovery unit 510. This advertisement message may be transmitted by a multicast method.[0097] In contrast, the CP 400 transmits a response message in response to a search message for searching for the CD 500 to be used by the CP 400.[0098] The description unit 520 serves to generate a description file that includes information on a device and service of the CD 500 and to transmit the generated description file to the CP 400. In the UPnP network, a device description file and a service description file determined at the UPnP Forum may be used as the description files.[0099] In the UPnP-based network system according to another exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the CD 500 provides a description change advertisement service 560. The description change advertisement service is a basic service provided by the CD 500, which recognizes the addition or deletion of another service provided by the CD 500, generates an event message, and notifies the CP 400 of the generated event message.[0100] When the CD 500 takes part in the network, it transmits the advertisement message containing basic information in order to notify the CP 400 of its existence, and the advertisement message may include information on the description change advertisement service 560.[0101] Also, the message control unit 410 of the CP 400 is preset to request subscription of the description change advertisement service 560 included in the advertisement message transmitted by the CD 500 in the discovery step.[0102] Accordingly, the CP 400 stores device information and service information of the CD 500 in the cache data storage unit 420 by parsing the received device description file and service description file in XML format.[0103] At this time, the CP 400 can recognize information on the description change advertisement service included in the device description file and the service description file.[0104] FIG. 8 is a view illustrating an example of a device description file in a UPnP-based network system according to another exemplary embodiment of the present invention.[0105] As illustrated in FIG. 8, a device description file in XML format includes information on a service type, a service ID, a service description URL, a control URL, and an eventing URL in the <service> tag. The device description file also includes information on a UPnP Forum, defined services, and services added by a UPnP vendor in the <serviceList> tag.[0106] Accordingly, information on the description change advertisement services 560 and 521 is additionally defined in the <serviceList> tag of the device description file. In FIG. 8, it is exemplified that the description change advertisement services 560 and 521 are additionally defined as “ChangeNotify” type services. In defining the description change advertisement services 560 and 521, information on a service type, a service ID, a service description URL, a control URL, an eventing URL, and so forth, can be changed by those of ordinary skill in the art.[0107] FIG. 9 is a view illustrating an example of a service description file in a UPnP-based network system according to another exemplary embodiment of the present invention.[0108] As illustrated in FIG. 9, a service description file of an XML format includes a list of actions that are commands for service responses in <actionList> tag, and information on arguments that are parameters of the respective actions in <action> tag. Also, the service description file includes related state variables in <serviceStateTable> tag. The service description file may additionally include a UPnP Forum, defined services, or actions added by the UPnP vendor in the <actionList> tag, and includes a UPnP Forum, defined services, or state variables in the <service StateTable> tag.[0109] Accordingly, actions 522 for the description change advertisement service 560 and related state variable information 523 can be additionally defined in <actionList> and <serviceStateTable> tags of the device description file. This information can be changed by those of ordinary skill in the art.[0110] The eventing unit 540 serves to generate an event message according to the state change of the service provided by the CD 500, and to transmit the generated event message to the CP 400.[0111] If the CP 400 intends to know the state change of the service provided by the CD 500 to be used by the CP 400, the CD 500 generates and transmits a subscription request message to the eventing URL included in the information on the CD 500 acquired in the discovery step. This step is called a subscription step. Thereafter, the CD 500 registers the CP 400 that has sent a registration request message, and if the state change of the service provided from the CD 500 or a specified eventing situation is generated, it transmits the corresponding event message to the registered CP 400.[0112] In contrast, in the UPnP network, GENA (Generic Event Notification Architecture) based on the HTTP header may be used as a protocol for the eventing step of the device.[0113] As described above, the UPnP-based network system may have a function of the CP 400 or the CD 500, or may have both functions of the CP 400 and the CD 500.[0114] Hereinafter, a method of controlling an UPnP-based network system as constructed above according to another exemplary embodiment of the present invention will be described.[0115] FIGS. 10A and 10B are flowcharts illustrating a process of recognizing addition or deletion of a service in a UPnP-based network system according to another exemplary embodiment of the present invention.[0116] FIG. 10A shows a process in which the CP requests a subscription to the CD in order to use the description change advertisement service.[0117] First, for a predetermined period, the UPnP-based CD 500 transmits an advertisement message including its device information and service information that can be provided by the CD itself in a multicast method (S601). At this time, The UPnP-based CP 400 receives the advertisement message, confirms the UDN of the CD 500 (S602), and then determines whether the CD, having sent the message, is identical to the existing CD 500 (S603).[0118] If the CP 400 determines that the CD 500, having sent the message, is a new CD 500 through the confirmation of the UDN in operation S603, the CP 400 transmits a description request message to the CD 500 in order to receive a device description file and a service description file (S604). In this case, the CD 500 transmits the device description file and the service description file of an XML format to the CP 400 in response to the description request message (S605). Then, the CP 400 stores device information and service information of the CD 500 in the cache data storage unit 420 by parsing the received device description file and service description file in XML format (S606). At this time, the CP can recognize information on the description change advertisement service included in the device description file and the service description file.[0119] Then, the CP 400 transmits an event subscription request message to the CD 500 in order to use the description change advertisement service defined in the device description file transmitted from the CD 500 (S607). The subscription request message is a message in XML format that uses the GENA protocol. The CD 500 registers the URL information of the CP 400, having transmitted the subscription request message, in its own subscription list (S608). Accordingly, if the addition or deletion of a service occurs in the CD 500, the event message is transmitted to the CP 400.[0120] If the CP 400 determines that the CD 500, having sent the message, is identical to the existing CD 500 through the confirmation of the UDN in operation S603, it does not download the device description file and the service description file of the corresponding CD 500, but performs only the updating of the expiration time of the CD 500 stored in the cache data storage unit 420 (S609).[0121] FIG. 10B shows a process in which the CP recognizes the addition or deletion of a service when the service is added to or deleted from the CD.[0122] If a new service is added to the CD 500 or the existing service is deleted (S701), an event message according to the addition or deletion of the service is generated through the description change advertisement service basically provided in the CD 500 (S702).[0123] The CD 500 transmits the event message according to the addition or deletion of the service to the CP 400 (S703). At this time, the CP 400, having received the event message, is the CP 400 registered in the CD 500 through the subscription request in the description change advertisement service of the CD 500.[0124] The CP 400, having received the event message, transmits the description request message to the CD 500 in order to receive the device description file and the service description file (S704). Then, the CD 500 transmits the device description file and the service description file of XML format to the CP 400 in response to the description request message (S705). Then, the CP 400 stores the device information and the service information of the CD 500 in the cache data storage unit 420 by parsing the received device description file and service description file of XML format (S706).[0125] As described above, according to the UPnP-based network system according to another exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the description change advertisement service 560 is basically provided to the CD 500, and the CP 400 can recognize the addition or deletion of the service by defining the description change advertisement service 560 in the device description file and the service description file of XML format transmitted from the CD 500 in the description step and by adding actions, factors, and related state variables for the service.[0126] FIGS. 11A and 11B are exemplary views explaining that the UPnP-based network system of FIG. 10 recognizes the addition or deletion of a service at the description step according to another exemplary embodiment of the present invention.[0127] FIG. 11A shows an example of requesting a subscription to the CD 500 in order for the CP 400 to use the description change advertisement service. That is, the CP 400 receives the device description file and the service description file (S605) by transmitting the description request message to the CD 500 (S604), and then transmits the event subscription request message to the CD 500 in order to use the description change advertisement service defined in the device description file (S607).[0128] FIG. 11B shows an example of generating a service addition or deletion event message in the description change advertisement service 560 of the CD 500 and transmitting the generated message to the CP 400 after the service is added or deleted. That is, if the service is added or deleted in the CD 500 (S701), the CD 500 generates an event message in the description change advertisement service (S702), and transmits the generated event message to the CP 400 (S703). The CP 400 transmits the description request message to the CD 500 (S704), and receives the device description file and the service description file (S705).[0129] According to the related art UPnP-based network system, even though the service is dynamically changed such as addition of a new service to the CD, the CP determines only whether a new device is added by confirming a UDN in an advertisement message, and thus it becomes impossible to recognize the addition of a service such as the addition of a new service or deletion of the service. This is because, in the UPnP-based CD, the addition or deletion of a service corresponds to the characteristic of a static home network environment. However, the addition or deletion of a service is required in the mobile network environment, and thus the existing PnP technology has limitations in this regard.[0130] However, according to the UPnP-based network system according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the CD 200 records information on the addition or deletion of a service in an extension header defined in a transmitted advertisement message, and the CP 100 recognizes such information, so that the addition or deletion of the service that is provided in a mobile network environment can be supported.[0131] Also, according to the UPnP-based network system according to another exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the description change advertisement service 560 is basically provided to the UPnP-based CD 500, and the CP 400 can recognize the addition or deletion of the service by defining the description change advertisement service 560 in the device description file and the XML service description file transmitted from the CD 500 at the description step and by adding actions, factors, and related state variables for the service. Accordingly, the addition or deletion of the service provided in a mobile network environment can be supported.[0132] In the exemplary embodiments of the present invention, the term “unit”, as used herein, means, but is not limited to, a software or hardware component, such as a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) or an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), which performs certain tasks. A unit may advantageously be configured to reside on the addressable storage medium and configured to execute on one or more processors. Thus, a unit may include, by way of example, components, such as software components, object-oriented software components, class components and task components, processes, functions, attributes, procedures, subroutines, segments of program code, drivers, firmware, microcode, circuitry, data, databases, data structures, tables, arrays, and variables.

        "modeForInvention": "The present invention relates to Local Area Network communication, and more particularly to a system and method for time stamping a measurement report that ensures correctness of a reference time.\nIn general, there are two variants of WLANs: infrastructure-based and ad hoc-type. In the former network, communication typically takes place only between the wireless nodes, called stations (STA), and an access point (AP) that is also a STA., which together form a basic service set (BSS). Communication takes place directly between wireless nodes (STAs) which form an independent basic service set (IBSS) in the ad hoc-type network.\nIn a WLAN, measurements are requested and reported between Radio Measurement-capable STAs. Measurements on non-serving channels are dedicated measurements, requiring the measuring STA to interrupt its normal operation, switch channels and acquire radio measurements. Measurements on a serving channel are executed by a STA as concurrent measurements. While a Measurement-capable STA is responsible for decoding and interpreting each Measurement Report Frame and assessing its impact on its own performance, the execution of some Measurement requests is optional and may be ignored by a receiving STA if its execution would significantly degrade the STA's performance.\nA STA may measure one or more channels itself or a STA may request other STAs in the same BSS or IBSS to measure one or more channels on its behalf. When requesting other STAs to measure one or more channels, a STA employs a Measurement Request Frame specifying therein at least one Measurement Request element.\nThe Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.11-1999 standard is a protocol standard for wireless LANs (WLANs) that focuses on the media access control (MAC) and physical (PHY) layers and is hereby incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein. In the IEEE 802.11(h) and IEEE 802.11(k) draft supplements to this standard, which are hereby incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein, measurement requests include a time reference specifying when a requested measurement is to be started. For example, as illustrated inFIG. 1A, a Measurement Offset parameter100and an Activation Delay parameter101together specify the reference time in IEEE TGh and TGk. Activation Delay is the measurement activation delay in number of target beacon transmission times (TBTTs) and Measurement Offset is the measurement offset in timer units (TUs).FIG. 1Billustrates the measurement requests allowed.\nDue to channel conditions, more than one attempt may be made to communicate a measurement request to a destination station (STA). At the receiving STA, if more than one copy of the same measurement request is received, then the STA discards the most recently received duplicate packets. This is according to the protocol specified in the IEEE 802.11 standard.\nThe discard of duplicate frames at the receiving STA, according to the IEEE 802.11 protocol, may result in the requesting and receiving STA each having a different reference beacon from which each references measurement start times. For example, if a measurement request is intended to be transmitted in one beacon period and, due to channel conditions, the recipient STA receives the frame correctly while its ACK is not received back at the transmitting STA, and if subsequently the measurement request is successfully transmitted in another beacon period, then, at the transmitting and receiving stations the reference beacons differ.\nEmbodiments of the present invention provide a method and system that resolves the ambiguity in a WLAN measurement report by including timer values in measurement reports. The time a measurement is requested to be performed and the actual time the measurement is made can then be compared by the requestor to ensure that no ambiguity occurs. In an embodiment of the present invention for an IEEE 802.11 WLAN, time synchronization function (TSF) timer values are included in measurement reports.\nIn a preferred embodiment, a Measurement Report Frame and element are modified to contain a field with an absolute time reference. For an IEEE 802.11 WLAN the absolute time reference is the value of TSF time (or part thereof) when requested measurements start. In all embodiments, comparison is made between the intended (requested) time to start the measurements and the time measurements actually started to ensure that no protocol ambiguities occurred.\nFIG. 1Aillustrates parameters of a service primitive that requests the transmission of a measurement request to a peer entity in a WLAN;\nFIG. 1Billustrates the measurement requests allowed in a WLAN;\nFIG. 2Ais a simplified block diagram illustrating the architecture of a basic service set (BSS) wireless communication system whereto embodiments of the present invention are to be applied;\nFIG. 2Bis a simplified block diagram illustrating the architecture of an ad hoc-type independent basic service set (IBSS) wireless communication system whereto embodiments of the present invention are to be applied;\nFIG. 3illustrates a simplified block diagram of an access point (AP) and each station (STA) within a particular basic service set (BSS) or independent basic service set (IBSS) according to an embodiment of the present invention;\nFIG. 4illustrates a Measurement Report Frame format according to an embodiment of the present invention;\nFIG. 5Aillustrates a Measurement Report Element format according to an embodiment of the present invention; and\nFIG. 5Billustrates a Measurement Report mode field of the Measurement Report Element illustrated inFIG. 5A, according to an embodiment of the present invention.\nIn the following description, by way of explanation rather than limitation, specific details are set forth such as the particular architecture, interfaces, techniques, etc., in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. However, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced in other wireless network embodiments that depart from these specific details.\nFIG. 2Ais a representative infrastructure basic service set (BSS) wireless network whereto embodiments of the present invention are to be applied. As shown inFIG. 2A, an access point (AP)200is coupled to a plurality of mobile stations (STAi)201, which, through wireless links202are communicating with each other and the AP via a plurality of wireless channels. A key principle of the present invention is to provide a mechanism to time stamp reports of measurements taken by the STAi201so that protocol ambiguities can be avoided should they occur and, therefore, makes it possible to employ corrective actions after the fact. It should be noted that the network shown inFIG. 2is small for purposes of illustration. In practice most networks would include a much larger number of mobile STAi201.FIG. 2Bis a representative ad hoc-type independent basic service set (IBSS) wireless network whereto embodiments of the present invention are to be applied. As shown inFIG. 2B, a plurality of mobile stations (STA i)201communicate with each other through wireless links202without any AP.\nReferring toFIG. 3, the AP200and each STAi201within the WLAN ofFIGS. 2Aand B may include a system with an architecture that is illustrated in the block diagram ofFIG. 3. Both the AP200and each STAi201may include a receiver301, a demodulator302, a measurement circuit303, a memory304, a control processor305, a timer306, a modulator307, and a transmitter308. The exemplary system300ofFIG. 3is for descriptive purposes only. Although the description may refer to terms commonly used in describing particular mobile stations, the description and concepts equally apply to other processing systems, including systems having architectures dissimilar to that shown inFIG. 3.\nIn a preferred embodiment, the receiver301and the transmitter308are coupled to an antenna (not shown) to convert received measurement reports and transmit desired measurement requests into corresponding digital data via the demodulator302and the modulator307, respectively. The measurement acquisition circuit operates under the control of the processor305to the process received Measurement Report Frames comprising measurements and corresponding time stamps or to make requested or periodic measurements (autonomously) in which measurements are conveyed along with corresponding time stamps in Measurement Report Frames.FIG. 1Bshows possible requestor and measurer combinations for both IBSS and BSS IEEE 802.11 WLANs embodiments of the present invention. The timer306is used to set the time stamp in the Measurement Report Frames that indicates the start time of the measurement being reported.\nFIG. 4illustrates a format for a Measurement Report Frame body400according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. In an IEEE 802.11 WLAN embodiment of the present invention, the Measurement Report Frame body400uses an Action frame body format and is transmitted by a STA201in response to a Measurement Request Frame or by a STA201autonomously providing measurement information. In all embodiments, the Category field401is set equal to a value indicating a Radio Measurement category or Spectrum Management category. The Action field402is set equal to a value indicating a Measurement Report is contained therein. The Dialog Token field403is set equal to a value in a corresponding Measurement Request Frame. If the Measurement Report Frame400is not being transmitted in response to a Measurement Request Frame then the Dialog Token field402is set equal to zero. In a preferred embodiment, at least one of (1) the Time Stamp field404of a Measurement Report Frame contains the value of an absolute time reference at the time when the STA started measuring the first reported measurement and (2) at least one Measurement Report Element405500is time-stamped504. The Measurement Report Elements field405contains at least one Measurement Report Elements500, as illustrated inFIG. 5A. The number of Measurement Report elements500and length of the Measurement Report Elements field405in a Measurement Report Frame400is limited by the maximum allowed medium access control (MAC) management protocol data unit (MMPDU) size.\nEach Measurement Report Element500contains a measurement report of a measurement made by a STA201. The format of a Measurement Report Element500of a preferred embodiment is shown inFIG. 5B. The Element ID field501is set to an identifier assigned by a corresponding measurement request (e.g., according to IEEE 802.11 standard it is 39 for Measurement report.) The Length field502is variable and depends on the length of the Measurement Report field507. The minimum value of the Length field is 3 (e.g., reporting a Measurement Mode equal to Incapable or Refused and using a zero-length Measurement Report field). The Measurement Token field503is set equal to the Measurement Token in the corresponding measurement request. If the Measurement Report element is being sent autonomously by a STA then the Measurement Token field503is set equal to zero. The Time Stamp field504is set to the value of an absolute timer when the requested measurement is started for each Measurement Element reported in a Measurement Report Frame400, which is a TSF timer value for an IEEE 802.11 embodiment of the present invention. It should be noted that either or both Time-Stamp fields404and504can be present in a Measurement Report.\nThe inclusion of the actual time504of a Measurement Element500increases the confidence level of the measurement and when several STAs201report the same measurement at close but different time actual times504, this confidence level is further enhanced. In addition, the frequency of transmitted and requested measurement reports helps guide STAs201in requesting and making measurement reports, e.g., if a report is received by a STA201at 1:00 and 1:05 the STA201can request or report measurements at 1:10 to obtain or provide, respectively, a reliable measurement of a given element(s).\nWhile the preferred embodiments of the present invention have been illustrated and described, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes and modifications may be made, and equivalents may be substituted for elements thereof without departing from the true scope of the present invention.

        "modeForInvention": "CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS\nThis application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. 119(e) of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/872,945, entitled “Beacon Design for Wireless Communication Systems”, filed on Dec. 4, 2006, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n1. Field of the Invention\nThe present invention relates to wireless transmission of video information, and in particular, to transmission of uncompressed high definition video information over wireless channels.\n2. Description of the Related Technology\nWith the proliferation of high quality video, an increasing number of electronic devices, such as consumer electronic devices, utilize high definition (HD) video which can require multiple gigabit per second (Gbps) or more in bandwidth for transmission. As such, when transmitting such HD video between devices, conventional transmission approaches compress the HD video to a fraction of its size to lower the required transmission bandwidth. The compressed video is then decompressed for consumption. However, with each compression and subsequent decompression of the video data, some data can be lost and the picture quality can be reduced.\nThe High-Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI) specification allows transfer of uncompressed HD signals between devices via a cable. While consumer electronics makers are beginning to offer HDMI-compatible equipment, there is not yet a suitable wireless (e.g., radio frequency) technology that is capable of transmitting uncompressed HD video signals. Wireless local area network (WLAN) and similar technologies can suffer interference issues when several devices that do not have the bandwidth to carry the uncompressed HD signals are connected to the network.\nSUMMARY OF CERTAIN INVENTIVE ASPECTS\nThe system, method, and devices of the invention each have several aspects, no single one of which is solely responsible for its desirable attributes. Without limiting the scope of this invention as expressed by the claims which follow, its more prominent features will now be discussed briefly.\nIn one embodiment, there is a system for wireless communication of uncompressed video, the system comprising a processor for generating a beacon length indication value representing the time length of a beacon frame, a memory in data communication with the processor to store the beacon length indication value, and a transmitter for wirelessly transmitting the beacon length indication value.\nIn another embodiment, there is a system for wireless communication of uncompressed video, the system comprising a receiver for wirelessly receiving a beacon length indication value representing the time length of a beacon frame, a memory to store the beacon length indication value, and a processor in data communication with the memory for initiating and completing a process for contending a current low rate physical layer (LRP) channel using the beacon length indication value.\nIn another embodiment, there is a method of processing of beacon frames in a system for wireless communication of uncompressed video, the method comprising generating a beacon length indication value representing the time length of a beacon frame, storing the beacon length indication value in a beacon frame, and wirelessly transmitting the beacon frame.\nIn another embodiment, there is a method of processing of beacon frames in a system for wireless communication of uncompressed video, the method comprising wirelessly receiving a beacon frame that includes a beacon length indication value representing the time length of a beacon frame by a receiving station, and initiating and completing a process for contending a current low rate physical layer (LRP) channel using the beacon length indication value by the receiving station.\nIn another embodiment, there is a computer-usable medium in a system for wireless communication of uncompressed video having computer readable code, the medium comprising instructions for processing and storing a beacon length indication value representing the time length of a beacon frame.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN INVENTIVE EMBODIMENTS\nCertain embodiments provide a method and system for transmission of uncompressed HD video information from a sender to a receiver over wireless channels.\nThe following detailed description is directed to certain sample embodiments of the invention. However, the invention can be embodied in a multitude of different ways as defined and covered by the claims. In this description, reference is made to the drawings wherein like parts are designated with like numerals throughout.\nEmbodiments include systems and methods of data processing in wireless communication devices for communication of uncompressed video data will be described. Video data may include one or more of motion video, still images, or any other suitable type of visual data. In particular, various embodiments representing novel beacon design for efficient formatting and processing of beacon frames for communication of uncompressed video data will be described.\nExemplary implementations of the embodiments in a wireless high definition (HD) audio/video (A/V) system will now be described.FIG. 1shows a functional block diagram of a wireless network100that implements uncompressed HD video transmission between A/V devices such as an A/V device coordinator and A/V stations, according to certain embodiments. In other embodiments, one or more of the devices can be a computer, such as a personal computer (PC). The network100includes a device coordinator112and multiple client devices or A/V stations114(e.g., Device1. . . Device N).\nThe A/V stations114utilize a low-rate (LR) wireless channel116(dashed lines inFIG. 1), and may use a high-rate (HR) channel118(heavy solid lines inFIG. 1), for communication between any of the devices. The device coordinator112uses a low-rate channel116and a high-rate wireless channel118, for communication with the stations114. Each station114uses the low-rate channel116for communications with other stations114. The high-rate channel118supports single direction unicast transmission over directional beams established by beamforming, with e.g., multi-Gb/s bandwidth, to support uncompressed HD video transmission. For example, a set-top box can transmit uncompressed video to a HD television (HDTV) over the high-rate channel118. The low-rate channel116can support bi-directional transmission, e.g., with up to 40 Mbps throughput in certain embodiments. The low-rate channel116is mainly used to transmit control frames such as acknowledgement (ACK) frames. For example, the low-rate channel116can transmit an acknowledgement from the HDTV to the set-top box. It is also possible that some low-rate data like audio and compressed video can be transmitted on the low-rate channel between two devices directly. Time division duplexing (TDD) is applied to the high-rate and low-rate channel. At any one time, the low-rate and high-rate channels cannot be used in parallel for transmission, in certain embodiments. Beamforming technology can be used in both low-rate and high-rate channels. The low-rate channels can also support omni-directional transmissions.\nIn one example, the device coordinator112is a receiver of video information (referred to as “receiver112”), and the station114is a sender of the video information (referred to as “sender114”). For example, the receiver112can be a sink of video and/or audio data implemented, such as, in an HDTV set in a home wireless network environment which is a type of WLAN. The sender114can be a source of uncompressed video or audio. Examples of the sender114include a set-top box, a DVD player or recorder, a digital camera, a camcorder, and so forth.\nFIG. 2illustrates a functional block diagram of an example communication system200. The system200includes a wireless transmitter202and wireless receiver204. The transmitter202includes a physical (PHY) layer206, a media access control (MAC) layer208and an application layer210. Similarly, the receiver204includes a PHY layer214, a MAC layer216, and an application layer218. The PHY layers provide wireless communication between the transmitter202and the receiver204via one or more antennas through a wireless medium201.\nThe application layer210of the transmitter202includes an A/V pre-processing module211and an audio video control (AV/C) module212. The A/V pre-processing module211can perform pre-processing of the audio/video such as partitioning of uncompressed video. The AV/C module212provides a standard way to exchange AN capability information. Before a connection begins, the AV/C module negotiates the AN formats to be used, and when the need for the connection is completed, AV/C commands are used to stop the connection.\nIn the transmitter202, the PHY layer206includes a low-rate (LR) channel203and a high rate (HR) channel205that are used to communicate with the MAC layer208and with a radio frequency (RF) module207. In certain embodiments, the MAC layer208can include a packetization module (not shown). The PHY/MAC layers of the transmitter202add PHY and MAC headers to packets and transmit the packets to the receiver204over the wireless channel201.\nIn the wireless receiver204, the PHY/MAC layers214,216process the received packets. The PHY layer214includes a RF module213connected to the one or more antennas. A LR channel215and a HR channel217are used to communicate with the MAC layer216and with the RF module213. The application layer218of the receiver204includes an A/V post-processing module219and an AV/C module220. The module219can perform an inverse processing method of the module211to regenerate the uncompressed video, for example. The AV/C module220operates in a complementary way with the AV/C module212of the transmitter202.\nFIG. 3illustrates a sequence of superframes and a decomposition of an example of a superframe time period that may be used in a wireless network such as illustrated inFIG. 1according to one embodiment. Many time division duplexing (TDD) channel access control schemes known to those in the art can be used to coordinate transmissions of the low-rate and high-rate channels within a network. The goal of the TDD scheme is to only have one of the two channels, low-rate or high-rate, being used for transmission at any one time. An example of a channel access control scheme used to coordinate the low-rate and high-rate channels is a superframe-based scheme.FIG. 3is an illustration of a sequence of superframes that may be used in a wireless network such as illustrated inFIG. 1. In a superframe base transmission system, the transmission time is divided into a series of superframes310,320,330,340. The length of time of the superframe is made small enough to allow for frequent medium access control (this cuts down on delays in processing control signals that enable access), but is made long enough to provide for efficient throughput of uncompressed video data. Large delays in processing user commands, such as on/off, channel switch, volume change, etc., will negatively affect the user experience. For these reasons, a superframe time is typically in a range from about 16 msec. to about 100 msec., but can vary from this range in other embodiments.\nIn the example superframe scheme shown in the lower portion ofFIG. 3, a representative superframe320is divided into three main time frames, a beacon frame321, a control period frame322and a frame for reserved and unreserved channel time blocks (CTBs)323. The time frame323for reserved and unreserved CTBs is herein referred to as the CTB frame323.\nThe lower portion ofFIG. 3illustrates a time division duplexing of the low rate channel (LRC)302and high rate channel (HRC)304within a superframe period according to one embodiment. In certain embodiments, only the LRC302is used for transmission during the beacon frame321, and the control period frame322. Both the high-rate and low-rate channels can be used for transmission during the CTB frame323. Any of the beacon frame321, the control frame322and the CTB frame323can have either fixed or variable durations, depending on the embodiment. Likewise, the superframe time duration can be fixed or variable, depending on the embodiment.\nThe control period frame322is used to allow client devices to transmit control messages to a device coordinator. Control messages may include network/device association and disassociation, device discovery, time slot reservations, device capability and preference exchanges, etc. The control period frame322may use a contention based access system such as Aloha, slotted Aloha, CSMA (carrier sensed multiple access), etc., to allow multiple devices to send control messages and to handle collisions of messages from multiple devices. When a message from a client device is received at a device coordinator without suffering a collision, the device coordinator can respond to the request of the message in the beacon frame321of a subsequent superframe330or in a separate control message. The response may be a time slot reservation of a CTB in one or more subsequent superframes, such as superframes330or340.\nThe CTB frame323is used for all other transmissions other than beacon messages and contention based control messages which are transmitted in the beacon frame321and the control frame322. A CTB frame can include any number of reserved or unreserved CTBs. Each CTB may have single or multiple data frames. Reserved CTBs324,325are used to transmit commands, isochronous streams and asynchronous data connections. CTBs can be reserved for transmission by a coordinator device to a specific client device, for transmission by a client device to a device coordinator, for transmission by a client device to another client device, etc. In one embodiment as shown inFIG. 3, a schedule concept is introduced to organize reserved CTBs. In each superframe, one schedule can have only one reserved CTB (for example, for pre-scheduled beam searching or bandwidth reservation signaling) or can have multiple periodical reserved CTBs (for example, for an isochronous stream). Unreserved CTBs328in the CTB frame323are usually used for communication of further contention based commands such as remote control commands and MAC control and management commands on the low-rate channel304. In certain embodiments, no beamforming transmission is allowed within unreserved CTBs.\nI. Beacon Design\nA beacon frame is used for multiple purposes. One purpose is to set the timing allocations for the reserved and unreserved CTBs of the CTB frame323. A device coordinator112, such as a television set, for example, communicates reserved time slots to the multiple client devices114in a network, such as the network100inFIG. 1. The beacon frames311,321,331,341are transmitted periodically to identify the start of the superframes310,320,330,340. In certain embodiments, a configuration of the superframe and other parameters is carried in the beacon frame. For example, the beacon frame321may carry the timing information of different schedules associated with the reserved CTBs324,325.\nIn one embodiment, the beacon frame321uses a long low rate physical layer protocol data unit (LRPPDU) format400such as shown inFIG. 4a. In particular, the beacon frame uses a long low-rate physical layer (LRP) preamble410and is sent in the default LRP mode. The long LRP preamble410is followed by a long LRP header420. The long LRP header420is followed by a MAC header430. The MAC header430is followed by a header check sequence (HCS) field440. The HCS field440is followed by a medium access control protocol data unit (MPDU) field450. The MPDU field450is followed by a beam tracking field460. As shown inFIG. 4b, the long LRP header420includes a LRP mode index field421, a MPDU length field423, a scrambler initialization field425, a beam tracking field427, and a reserved field429. The long LRP header420and the MPDU length field423, in particular, will be discussed below in reference to the beacon length indication in Section III.\na. Beacon Frame Format\nFIG. 5ashows various fields in a beacon frame500that may be used in a superframe320such as illustrated inFIG. 3according to one embodiment. In certain embodiments, the beacon frame500includes a MAC header510and MAC payload information570. The MAC payload information refers to all fields that come after the MAC header510. In certain embodiments, the MAC payload information includes a Beacon Control field520, a Random Access Time Block (RATB) field530, a TimeStamp field540, and one or more information elements (IEs)550and a Cyclic Redundancy Check(CRC) field560. The value for the CRC field560is calculated over all the IEs in the beacon frame. The RATB End Time530field indicates the end time of the contention-based control period (RATB). It is defined as the time offset from the starting time position of the beacon in units of 4 microseconds, in one embodiment. The RATB is a special unreserved CTB which is immediately after the beacon frame in each superframe. The RATB is used for devices to send urgent control/management commands through contention. The TimeStamp field540carries the actual starting transmission time of the current beacon frame and will be discussed in detail below in reference toFIGS. 7 and 8. The Beacon Control field520contains various control bits configured for reducing size and processing time of beacon frame and will be discussed in detail below in reference toFIG. 5b. For the purpose of this discussion, information elements550may be classified as schedule information elements and non-schedule information elements. The information elements (IEs)550are organized with the reserved schedule IEs first. The schedule information elements are information elements that describe the properties of the reserved CTBs in the CTB frame323. In certain embodiments, there are two kinds of schedule IEs: static schedule IES and dynamic schedule IEs. Static schedule IEs may contain the persistent schedule timing information for A/V streams which usually last a long time. Dynamic schedule IEs contain the schedule timing information for on-the-fly reservation for temporary transmission such as beam-searching, control message exchanging, and the like.\nIn some embodiments, one or more of the fields510,520,530,540,550of the beacon frame500ofFIG. 5may be rearranged and/or combined. In yet other embodiments, the beacon frame500may not include one or more of the fields shown inFIG. 5. In yet other embodiments, the beacon frame may include one or more fields in addition to the fields shown inFIG. 5a.\nb. Beacon Control field\nAs discussed above in reference toFIG. 5a, in one embodiment, the beacon frame500includes the beacon control field520.FIG. 5bshows various control bits in the beacon control field520that may be used in a beacon frame such as illustrated inFIG. 5aaccording to one embodiment. In certain embodiments, the beacon control field520includes a Configuration Change bit521, a Free Channel Time bit522, a Channel Schedule Change bit523, a Static Schedule IE Included bit524, a Coordinator Busy or Not bit525, a Distributed Mode bit526, and a Reserved bit527.\nIn a beacon frame, the Configuration Change bit521is configured to indicate whether there is a change in the MAC payload information570in the current beacon frame as compared to the previous beacon frame except for the change in the TimeStamp field540. Therefore, a change that the control bit indicates not only includes a change in a schedule IE, but also other changes such as a change in the length of the superframe. If there is no change, the Configuration Change bit521is set to “0” (zero). A station receiving this beacon frame only needs to parse the TimeStamp field and needs not parse any of the information elements (IEs) in the beacon frame, thereby achieving a reduction in beacon processing time. In an alternative embodiment, when the Configuration Change bit521is zero, the transmitted beacon frame may not even contain the unchanged information elements, thereby achieving a reduction in the beacon frame size as well as the reduction in beacon processing time.\nThe Free Channel Time bit522is configured to indicate whether there is still channel time available to accept a newbandwidth reservation request or allow devices to contend the channel at unreserved CTB(s). In certain embodiments, the Free Channel Time bit522is set to “0” (zero) if the coordinator decides not to allow any new reservations or allow devices to contend the channel at unreserved CTB(s). Otherwise, the Free Channel Time bit is set to “1”.\nThe Channel Schedule Change bit523is configured to indicate whether there is a channel time scheduling change in the current superframe compared to the previous superframe. For example, a channel time scheduling change occurs when a new schedule IE is added or a pre-existing schedule IE is deleted; when the timing information in one schedule IE is changed; or when the channel time block duration is enlarged or shortened. If there is no change, the Channel Schedule Change bit523is set to “0” and a station receiving this beacon frame does not need to parse schedule IEs in the beacon frame, thereby achieving a reduction in beacon processing time. In an alternative embodiment, when the Channel Schedule Change bit530is zero, the transmitted beacon frame may not even contain the unchanged schedule information elements, thereby achieving a reduction in the beacon frame size as well as the reduction in beacon processing time.\nThe Static Schedule IE Included bit524is configured to indicate whether static schedule IEs for persistent A/V streams are included in the current beacon. To reduce beacon overhead, including the size and processing time, static schedule IEs don't need to be included in every beacon frame. Instead, static schedule IEs may be included in beacon frames periodically with an interval longer than superframe duration. If no static schedule IE is included in the current beacon frame, the Static Schedule IE Included bit524is set to “0” (zero) and a station receiving this beacon frame needs not parse the static schedule IES in the beacon frame, thereby achieving a reduction in beacon processing time.\nThe Coordinator Busy or Not bit525is configured to indicate whether the coordinator is busy or not on handoff procedure. The Distributed Mode bit526is configured to indicate whether the coordinator is busy or not on handoff procedure.\nFIG. 6is a flowchart illustrating an example process600for the processing of various control bits in a beacon control field such as shown inFIG. 5b. The process600starts at state610, where a station (STA) receives a beacon control frame packet and parses the beacon control field to obtain various control bits including the Configuration Change bit521, the Channel Schedule Change bit523, and the Static Schedule IE Included bit524as discussed above in reference toFIG. 5b. After the receiving station parses the control bits, the process moves to a decision state620where the value of the Configuration Change bit521is tested. If the value is “0,” or such as indicating there was no change, the process proceeds to state680to parse only the TimeStamp field540in the beacon frame500as shown inFIG. 5b. On the other hand, if the value is “1,” or such as indicating there was a change, the process moves to a decision state630, where the value of Channel Schedule Change bit523is tested. If the value is “0,” or such as indicating there was no change, the process proceeds to state670where only non-schedule IEs among the received IEs are parsed, followed by the parsing of TimeStamp field (state680) discussed above. On the other hand, if the value is “1,” or such as indicating that there was a change, the process moves to a decision state640where the value of the Static Schedule IE Included bit is tested. If the value is “0,” or such as indicating there was no change, the process proceeds to state660where only dynamic schedule IEs among the received schedule IEs arc parsed followed by the parsing of non-schedule IEs (state670) and the parsing of TimeStamp field (state680) discussed above. On the other hand, if the value is “1,” or such as indicating that a static schedule IE is included, the process600moves to state650where the static schedule IEs are parsed, followed by the parsing of dynamic schedule IEs (state660), the parsing of non-schedule IEs (state670), and the parsing of TimeStamp field (state680) as discussed above.\nThus the process600provides an efficient method for a receiving station to process a beacon frame. The inclusion of the Configuration Change bit521eliminates the need to parse any of the information elements (IEs) when the current beacon frame contains no new IE as compared to the previous superframe. Likewise, the inclusion of the Channel Schedule Change bit523eliminates the need to parse any of the schedule IEs when the current beacon frame includes no new schedule IE as compared to the previous superframe. Also likewise, the inclusion of the Static Schedule IE Included bit524eliminates the need to parse any of the static schedule IEs when the current beacon frame contains no static schedule IEs. Thus, the use of various control bits described in process600improves the system efficiency by reducing the beacon processing time. Also in some embodiments, the use of the control bits reduces the size of the beacon frame itself as some of the unchanged IEs may not be included in the beacon frame in the first place.\nThe above-described method of processing a beacon frame may be realized in a program format to be stored on a computer readable recording medium that includes any kinds of recording devices for storing computer readable data, for example, a CD-ROM, a DVD, a magnetic tape, a memory (e.g., capable of storing firmware), memory card and a disk, and may also be realized in a carrier wave format (e.g., Internet transmission or Bluetooth transmission.) In some embodiments, the receiver112or the sender114shown inFIG. 1includes the computer readable recording medium and can also include a processor, controller, or other computing device.\nII. Time Stamp and Inter-Station Time Synchronization\nAs discussed above in reference toFIG. 5a, the beacon frame500includes the TimeStamp field540. The TimeStamp field540carries the actual starting transmission time of the current beacon frame that is used for inter-station time synchronization.FIG. 7is an illustration of a method of time synchronization between a transmitting station and a receiving station. The inter-station synchronization system700is designed to achieve a synchronization of time between a transmitting station (TX)710and a receiving station (RX)730. The transmitting station (TX)710may be a device coordinator112(FIG. 1) or a device or a station that is capable of transmitting a beacon frame to a coordinator or to another station. The transmission station (TX)710includes a medium access control layer (MAC-TX)711and a physical layer (PHY-TX)715. The receiving station (RX)730likewise includes a medium access control layer (MAC-RX)735and a physical layer (PHY-RX)731.\nIn certain embodiments, the PHY-TX715sets an accurate timer for strictly periodical beacon transmissions. Therefore, at time=ta0717, the MAC-TX711knows the exact transmission time (ta1) of the next beacon frame by the PHY-TX715and sets the value of the TimeStamp field540(FIG. 5a) to the next transmission time ta1719. The MAC-TX layer711sends the beacon frame with the TimeStamp field set to ta1719to the PHY-TX715. At ta1719, the time specified in the TimeStamp field, the PHY-TX715wirelessly transmits the beacon frame. The PHY-RX731of the receiving station (RX)730receives the beacon frame and records the reception time, ta3737, which represents the local time at which the PHY-RX731actually received the beacon frame. The PHY-RX layer731sends the beacon frame having the TimeStamp field540along with the newly recorded reception time, ta3737, to the MAC-RX735. The MAC-RX735layer at ta4739adjusts the RX's internal clock by a difference between the TimeStamp value (ta1) and the recorded reception time (ta3) in embodiments where the RX clock adjustment is done at the MAC layer.\nFIG. 8is a flowchart illustrating an example time synchronization process800corresponding to the time synchronization such as illustrated inFIG. 7. The time synchronization process800starts at state810, where the MAC-TX711sets the TimeStamp field of a beacon frame to the transmission time of the next beacon frame by the PHY-TX715(as measured with the transmission station clock), hereafter referred to as the “beacon transmission time,” which corresponds to ta1719shown inFIG. 7. The MAC-TX sends (state820) and the PHY-TX receives (state830) the beacon frame with the beacon transmission time in the TimeStamp field. At state840, the PHY-TX715wirelessly transmits the beacon frame at the beacon transmission time. At state850, the PHY-RX731receives the beacon frame. Upon receiving the beacon frame, the PHY-RX, at state860, records the time of the reception (as measured with the receiving station clock), hereafter referred to as the “beacon reception time”, which corresponds to ta3737shown inFIG. 7. Subsequent to the recording of the beacon reception time, the PHY-RX, at state870, sends the received beacon frame along with the beacon reception time to the MAC-RX. After receiving the beacon frame and parsing the TimeStamp field, the MAC-RX, at state880, adjusts the local clock at the receiving station by a difference between the beacon transmission time and the beacon reception time, thereby synchronizing time between the transmitting station710and the receiving station730.\nThe above-described method of time synchronization may be realized in a program format to be stored on a computer readable recording medium that includes any kinds of recording devices for storing computer readable data, for example, a CD-ROM, a DVD, a magnetic tape, a memory (e.g., capable of storing firmware), memory card and a disk, and may also be realized in a carrier wave format (e.g., Internet transmission or Bluetooth transmission.) In some embodiments, the receiver112or the sender114shown inFIG. 1includes the computer readable recording medium and can also include a processor, controller, or other computing device.\nIII. Beacon Length Indication\nFIG. 9is a timing and block diagram illustrating a method of beacon length indication for solving a problem of a long beacon processing delay at the MAC layer of a receiving station. The system includes a transmitting station910and a receiving station930. The transmitting station910includes a MAC layer (MAC-TX)911and a PHY layer (PHY-TX)913. The receiving station930includes a MAC layer (MAC-RX)931and a PHY layer (PHY-RX)933. At t=t0915, the MAC-TX911starts to create a new beacon frame900, similar to beacon frame500(FIG. 5). The new beacon frame900includes a PHY header called a long LRPPDU packet400. As discussed above in reference toFIG. 4a, the long LRPPDU packet400includes the long LRP header field420. Also as discussed in reference toFIG. 4b, the long LRP header field includes the MPDU length subfield423. The beacon frame packet900has a time duration of Δt916. The MAC-TX sends the beacon frame to the PHY-RX to be transmitted at a specified beacon transmission time (t=t1)917. The PHY-RX931of the receiving station930starts to receive the beacon frame at t=t2935and sends the beacon frame to the MAC-RX933. The MAC-RX933starts receiving the beacon frame at t=t3937beginning with the long LRP header420and ends receiving the beacon frame at a beacon received time (t=t4)938.\nAs discussed above in reference toFIGS. 5aand5b, the fields of information coming after the MAC header510(FIG. 5) are referred to the MAC payload information570. For example, the MAC payload information570comprises all IEs550as shown inFIG. 5including any schedule IEs. The MAC payload information570in the beacon frame is used to indicate the channel schedule and other information for the current superframe. However, since the beacon frame is processed at a MAC layer of a receiving station (MAC-RX)933, there may be a long delay up to 100 microseconds after the beacon frame packet is received by the MAC-RX at the beacon received time (t=t4)938, in certain embodiments. This is because the MAC-RX933does not know a priori the length of the beacon frame it is processing and, therefore, cannot contend (find free time on) the current LRP channel for transmission until the entire beacon frame is received at the beacon received time938. Therefore, the beacon processing extends beyond the beacon received time t4938to t5939. This post-reception contention process results in a dead processing time940.\nTo eliminate the dead processing time problem, in certain embodiments, a LRP payload indication primitive—PHY_LRP_Payload_length.indication( )—is introduced to carry a beacon length indication value from the PHY-RX931to the MAC-RX933a beacon length indication value. The beacon length indication value corresponds to the length of the currently received LRP packet The PHY-RX931obtains the beacon length indication value by parsing the MPDU length_subfield423of the LONG LRP header420received from the transmitting station910. Under this scheme, the MAC-RX933receives the beacon length indication prior to the beacon processing completion time939and can immediately contend the current LRP channel at the RATB without waiting for the beacon process completion at the MAC-RX933.\nFIG. 10is a flowchart illustrating an example process1000for processing the beacon length indication such as illustrated inFIG. 9. The process1000starts at state1010, where the MAC-TX, while assembling a new beacon frame900, stores a beacon length indication value in the MRDU length subfield423of the long LRP header420. As discussed above, the long LRP header420is a field of the long LRPPDU packet400shown inFIG. 9. At state1020, the PHY-TX1113starts to wirelessly transmit the beacon frame packet900beginning with the long LRPPDU packet400. At state1030, the PHY-RX931receives the long LRPPDU packet400of the beacon frame. At state1040, the PHY-RX931parses the long LRP header420portion of the long LRPPDU packet400to obtain the beacon length indication value stored in the MRDU length subfield423of the long LRP header420. At state1050, the PHY-RX931sends the beacon length indication value to the MAC-RX933. At state1060, after receiving the beacon length indication, the MAC-RX1131initiates the process for contending a current LRP channel immediately without waiting for the reception of the entire beacon frame, thereby eliminating the dead processing time940.\nThus the process1000provides an efficient method for a MAC-RX933to process a beacon frame. The reception of the beacon length indication allows the MAC-RX933to initiate a contention process for a current LRP channel without waiting for the reception of the entire length of the current beacon frame. This, in turn, eliminates the unnecessary dead processing time940that would have been associated with the post-completion contention for a current LRP channel.\nIf a receiving station (RX) cannot receive the LRP header420of a beacon frame correctly, then the RX cannot parse the LRP header to obtain the beacon length indication to know when the RATB will start. To solve this problem, one embodiment of this invention includes maxBeaconLen and minRATBLen constant parameters. If the RX does not receive the beacon frame within maxBeaconLen time from the nominal beacon starting time, it can send out a CTB information request packet to the coordinator within minRATBLen time.\nAs an alternative method to solve the long beacon processing delay at the MAC-RX, each beacon frame is configured to carry control and management information for the next superframe instead of the current superframe. Under this alternative method, the MAC-RX would know the length of the present beacon frame from the information received in the previous superframe.\nThe above-described method of beacon length indication may be realized in a program format to be stored on a computer readable recording medium that includes any kinds of recording devices for storing computer readable data, for example, a CD-ROM, a DVD, a magnetic tape, a memory or cache (e.g., capable of storing firmware), memory card and a disk, and may also be realized in a carrier wave format (e.g., Internet transmission or Bluetooth transmission.) In some embodiments, the receiver112or the sender114shown inFIG. 1includes the computer readable recording medium and can also include a processor, controller, or other computing device.\nCONCLUSION\nWhile the above detailed description has shown, described, and pointed out the fundamental novel features of the invention as applied to various embodiments, it will be understood that various omissions and substitutions and changes in the form and details of the system illustrated may be made by those skilled in the art, without departing from the intent of the invention.",
